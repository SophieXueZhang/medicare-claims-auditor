## 📈 System Performance Results

Latest testing based on 6 core demo cases (plus 78 extended test cases):

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Core Demo Cases | 6 cases (covering all risk levels) |
| Extended Test Suite | 78 cases (60 diverse + 18 bias tests) |
| Auto-Approval Rate | 33.3% (2 low-risk cases) |
| Manual Review Rate | 66.7% (4 medium/high-risk cases) |
| Total Claim Amount | $167,800.50 |
| Auto-Approved Amount | $6,300.00 |
| Efficiency Improvement | **33.3%** (audit time savings) |

### Processed Claim Types
- ✅ **Cataract Surgery** - Auto-approved (based on NCD_9 rules)
- ⏳ **Pacemaker Implantation** - Manual review (high-cost but covered)
- ✅ **Physical Therapy** - Auto-approved (low-risk item)
- ⏳ **Cosmetic Surgery** - Manual review (risk assessment required)
- ⏳ **Kidney Dialysis** - Manual review (medium risk)
- ⏳ **ICU Care** - Manual review (high-risk, high-cost)

## 🎯 Intelligent Decision Engine
