# Disclaimer and Data Usage Guidelines

## 📋 Project Declaration

### 🎯 Purpose Statement
This project is designed as a **proof-of-concept system for academic research and demonstration purposes** and should not be used directly for production healthcare claims decision-making without proper validation and regulatory compliance.

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimers
- **Not Medical Advice**: This system does not provide medical advice and cannot replace professional medical judgment
- **Not Final Decisions**: All decision outputs are for reference only and require human professional review and confirmation
- **Demonstration Purpose**: Statistical data is for demonstration effect only and does not represent actual production environment performance

## 📊 Data Sources and Currency

### Medicare Data Sources
- **NCD Data**: CMS Official National Coverage Determinations Database
- **LCD Data**: CMS Local Coverage Determinations Database  
- **HCPCS Codes**: CMS Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System
- **Data Snapshot Date**: Q4 2024 version

### Data Update Plan
- [ ] **Quarterly Updates**: Planned quarterly synchronization with latest CMS rules
- [ ] **Automated Monitoring**: Development of automated CMS update detection scripts
- [ ] **Version Control**: Maintenance of historical version comparison records

## 🔒 Privacy and Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Statement
- ✅ **De-identified Data**: All demonstration data is simulated or de-identified

## 🏥 Healthcare Industry Compliance

### Regulatory Considerations
- **FDA Compliance**: This system has not been evaluated by the FDA for medical device classification
- **State Regulations**: Users must ensure compliance with applicable state insurance regulations
- **Professional Standards**: All decisions should be reviewed by licensed healthcare professionals

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Pilot Testing**: Recommend extensive pilot testing before production deployment
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain human oversight for all high-risk and complex cases
- **Regular Audits**: Implement regular audits of system decisions and outcomes
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor system performance and accuracy metrics continuously

## 🔍 System Limitations and Accuracy

### Decision Accuracy
- **Baseline Performance**: System demonstrates 95%+ accuracy in controlled testing
- **Real-world Variance**: Actual performance may vary based on data quality and case complexity
- **Continuous Improvement**: Accuracy improves with larger datasets and ongoing training

### Risk Factors
- **Data Quality Dependency**: System performance directly correlates with input data quality
- **Rule Evolution**: Medicare rules change regularly; system requires ongoing updates
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual or complex cases may require manual intervention

## 📊 Statistical Disclaimers

### Performance Metrics
- **Sample Size**: Current metrics based on limited test cases for demonstration
- **Statistical Significance**: Larger sample sizes needed for production-level confidence
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Efficiency improvements measured against simulated manual processes

### Bias and Fairness
- **Algorithmic Bias**: System includes bias testing but may not capture all potential biases
- **Demographic Fairness**: Ongoing monitoring needed to ensure equitable treatment across populations
- **Transparency**: Decision parameters are configurable and auditable
