1,3,True,2,"310.1","Routine Costs in Clinical Trials",2024-05-27 00:00:00,2024-05-27 00:00:00,,"","<p>Effective for items and services furnished on or after July 9, 2007, Medicare covers the routine costs of qualifying clinical trials, as such costs are defined below, as well as reasonable and necessary items and services used to diagnose and treat complications arising from participation in all clinical trials. All other Medicare rules apply.</p>

<p>Routine costs of a clinical trial include all items and services that are otherwise generally available to Medicare beneficiaries (i.e., there exists a benefit category, it is not statutorily excluded, and there is not a national non-coverage decision) that are provided in either the experimental or the control arms of a clinical trial except:</p>
<ul><li>The investigational item or service, itself unless otherwise covered outside of the clinical trial;</li>
<li>Items and services provided solely to satisfy data collection and analysis needs and that are not used in the direct clinical management of the patient (e.g., monthly CT scans for a condition usually requiring only a single scan); and</li>
<li>Items and services customarily provided by the research sponsors free-of-charge for any enrollee in the trial.</li></ul>

<p>Routine costs in clinical trials include:</p>

<ul><li>Items or services that are typically provided absent a clinical trial (e.g., conventional care);</li>
<li>Items or services required solely for the provision of the investigational item or service (e.g., administration of a non-covered chemotherapeutic agent), the clinically appropriate monitoring of the effects of the item or service, or the prevention of complications; and</li>
<li>Items or services needed for reasonable and necessary care arising from the provision of an
investigational item or service&mdash;in particular, for the diagnosis or treatment of complications.</li></ul>
	
<p>This policy does not withdraw Medicare coverage for items and services that may be covered according to local coverage determination (LCDs) or the regulations on category B investigational device exemptions found in 42 CFR 405.201-405.215, 411.15, and 411.406. For information about LCDs, refer to <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/search.aspx"">https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/search.aspx</a> a searchable database of Medicare Administrative Contractor local policies.</p>

<p>For non-covered items and services, including items and services for which Medicare payment is statutorily prohibited, Medicare only covers the treatment of complications arising from the delivery of the noncovered item or service and unrelated reasonable and necessary care. However, if the item or service is not covered by virtue of a national non-coverage policy in Pub. 100-03, National Coverage Determination (NCD) Manual, and is the focus of a qualifying clinical trial, the routine costs of the clinical trial (as defined above) will be covered by Medicare but the non-covered item or service, itself, will not.</p>

<p><strong>A. Requirements for Medicare Coverage of Routine Costs</strong></p> 
 
<p>Any clinical trial receiving Medicare coverage of routine costs must meet the following three requirements:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>The subject or purpose of the trial must be the evaluation of an item or service that falls within a Medicare benefit category (e.g., physicians' service, durable medical equipment, diagnostic test) and is not statutorily excluded from coverage (e.g., cosmetic surgery, hearing aids).</li> 
 
<li>The trial must not be designed exclusively to test toxicity or disease pathophysiology. It must have therapeutic intent.</li> 
 
<li>Trials of therapeutic interventions must enroll patients with diagnosed disease rather than healthy volunteers. Trials of diagnostic interventions may enroll healthy patients in order to have a proper control group.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The three requirements above are insufficient by themselves to qualify a clinical trial for Medicare coverage of routine costs. Clinical trials also should have the following desirable characteristics; however, some trials, as described below, are presumed to meet these characteristics and are automatically qualified to receive Medicare coverage:</p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>The principal purpose of the trial is to test whether the intervention potentially improves the participants' health outcomes;</li> 
 
<li>The trial is well-supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use;</li> 
 
<li>The trial does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies;</li> 
 
<li>The trial design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the trial;</li> 
 
<li>The trial is sponsored by a credible organization or individual capable of executing the proposed trial successfully;</li> 
 
<li>The trial is in compliance with Federal regulations relating to the protection of human subjects; and</li> 
 
<li>All aspects of the trial are conducted according to the appropriate standards of scientific integrity.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p><strong>B. Qualification Process for Clinical Trials</strong></p> 
 
<p>Using the authority found in &sect;1142 of the Social Security Act (the Act) (cross-referenced in &#167;1862(a)(1)(E) of the Act), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) will convene a multi-agency Federal panel (the ""panel"") composed of representatives of the Department of Health and Human Services research agencies (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), AHRQ, and the Office of Human Research Protection), and the research arms of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop qualifying criteria that will indicate a strong probability that a trial exhibits the desirable characteristics listed above. These criteria will be easily verifiable, and where possible, dichotomous. Trials that meet these qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of their associated routine costs. This panel is not reviewing or approving individual trials. The multi-agency panel will meet periodically to review and evaluate the program and recommend any necessary refinements to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).</p> 
 
<p>Clinical trials that meet the qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of routine costs after the trial's lead principal investigator certifies that the trial meets the criteria. This process will require the principal investigator to enroll the trial in a Medicare clinical trials registry, currently under development.</p> 
 
<p>Some clinical trials are automatically qualified to receive Medicare coverage of their routine costs because they have been deemed by AHRQ, in consultation with the other agencies represented on the multi-agency panel to be highly likely to have the above-listed seven desirable characteristics of clinical trials. The principal investigators of these automatically qualified trials do not need to certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria, but must enroll the trials in the Medicare clinical trials registry for administrative purposes, once the registry is established.</p> 
 
<p>Effective September 19, 2000, clinical trials that are deemed to be automatically qualified are:</p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>Trials funded by NIH, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA;</li> 
 
<li>Trials supported by centers or cooperative groups that are funded by the NIH, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA;</li> 
 
<li>Trials conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) reviewed by the FDA; and</li> 
 
<li>Drug trials that are exempt from having an IND under 21 CFR 312.2(b)(1) will be deemed automatically qualified until the qualifying criteria are developed and the certification process is in place. At that time the principal investigators of these trials must certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria in order to maintain Medicare coverage of routine costs. This certification process will only affect the future status of the trial and will not be used to retroactively change the earlier deemed status.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>  The CMS, through the NCD process, through an individualized assessment of benefits, risks, and research potential, may determine that certain items and services for which there is some evidence of significant medical benefit, but for which there is insufficient evidence to support a &#8220;reasonable and necessary&#8221; determination, are only reasonable and necessary when provided in a clinical trial that meets the requirements defined in that NCD.</p> 
 
<p>Medicare will cover the routine costs of qualifying trials that either have been deemed to be automatically qualified, have certified that they meet the qualifying criteria, or are required through the NCD process, unless CMS's Chief Clinical Officer subsequently finds that a clinical trial does not meet the qualifying criteria or jeopardizes the safety or welfare of Medicare beneficiaries.</p> 
 
<p>Should CMS find that a trial's principal investigator misrepresented that the trial met the necessary qualifying criteria in order to gain Medicare coverage of routine costs, Medicare coverage of the routine costs would be denied under &sect;1862(a)(1)(E) of the Act. In the case of such a denial, the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the trial would not be held liable (i.e., would be held harmless from collection) for the costs consistent with the provisions of &sect;&sect;1879, 1842(l), or 1834(j)(4) of the Act, as applicable. Where appropriate, the billing providers would be held liable for the costs and fraud investigations of the billing providers and the trial's principal investigator may be pursued.</p> 
 
<p>Medicare regulations require Medicare+Choice (M+C) organizations to follow CMS NCDs.  This NCD raises special issues that require some modification of most M+C organizations' rules governing provision of items and services in and out of network. The items and services covered under this NCD are inextricably linked to the clinical trials with which they are associated and cannot be covered outside of the context of those clinical trials. M+C organizations therefore must cover these services regardless of whether they are available through in-network providers. M+C organizations may have reporting requirements when enrollees participate in clinical trials, in order to track and coordinate their members' care, but cannot require prior authorization or approval.</p>

When a physician contacts his patient's relatives or associates for this purpose, expenses of such interviews are properly chargeable as physician's services to the patient on whose behalf the information was secured. If the beneficiary is not an inpatient of a hospital, Part B reimbursement for such an interview is subject to the special limitation on payments for physicians' services in connection with mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders.</p>

Counseling principally concerned with the effects of the patient's condition on the individual being interviewed would not be reimbursable as part of the physician's personal services to the patient.

23,1,True,2,"10.3","Inpatient Hospital Pain Rehabilitation Programs",1966-01-01 00:00:00,,,"<p>  Pain rehabilitation programs are an innovative approach to the treatment of intractable pain. The goal of such programs is to give a patient the tools to manage and control his/her pain and thereby improve his/her ability to function independently.</p>

<p>  A hospital level pain rehabilitation program is one that employs a coordinated multidisciplinary team to deliver, in a controlled environment, a concentrated program that is designed to modify pain behavior through the treatment of the physiological, psychological, and social aspects of pain. Such programs generally include diagnostic testing, skilled nursing, psychotherapy, structured progressive withdrawal from pain medications, physical therapy and occupational therapy to restore physical fitness (mobility and endurance) to a maximal level within the constraints of a patient's physical disability, and the use of mechanical devices and/or activities to relieve pain or modify a patient's reaction to it (e.g., nerve stimulator, hydrotherapy, massage, ice, systemic muscle relaxation training, and diversional activities). </p>

<p>The nurse's responsibility in such pain rehabilitation programs is to observe and assess, on a continuing basis, a patient's condition and response to the program as reflected by his actions while in the nursing unit, and to assure that the atmosphere within the unit is not supportive of pain behavior. The day-to-day activities involved in carrying out the program are under the general supervision and, as needed, direct supervision of a physician.</p>","<p>  Since pain rehabilitation programs of a lesser scope than that described above would raise a question as to whether the program could be provided in a less intensive setting than on an inpatient hospital basis, carefully evaluate such programs to determine whether the program does, in fact, necessitate a hospital level of care. Some pain rehabilitation programs may utilize services and devices which are excluded from coverage, e.g., acupuncture dorsal column stimulator, and family counseling services. In determining whether the scope of a pain program does necessitate inpatient hospital care, evaluate only those services and devices which are covered. Although diagnostic tests may be an appropriate part of pain rehabilitation programs, such tests would be covered in an individual case only where they can be reasonably related to a patient's illness, complaint, symptom, or injury and where they do not represent an unnecessary duplication of tests previously performed.</p>

<p>  An inpatient program of 4 weeks' duration is generally required to modify pain behavior. After this period it would be expected that any additional rehabilitation services which might be required could be effectively provided on an outpatient basis under an outpatient pain rehabilitation program (see &#167;<a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=24&ncdver=1&DocID=10.4&kq=true&SearchType=Advanced&bc=EAAAAAgAAAAA&"">10.4</a> of the NCD Manual) or other outpatient program. The first 7-l0 days of such an inpatient program constitute, in effect, an evaluation period. If a patient is unable to adjust to the program within this period, it is generally concluded that it is unlikely that the program will be effective and the patient is discharged from the program. On occasions a program longer than 4&#160;weeks may be required in a particular case. In such a case there should be documentation to substantiate that inpatient care beyond a 4-week period was reasonable and necessary. Similarly, where it appears that a patient participating in a program is being granted frequent outside passes, a question would exist as to whether an inpatient program is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the patient's condition.</p>

<p>  An inpatient hospital stay for the purpose of participating in a pain rehabilitation program would be covered as reasonable and necessary to the treatment of a patient's condition where the pain is attributable to a physical cause, the usual methods of treatment have not been successful in alleviating it, and a significant loss of ability to function independently has resulted from the pain. Chronic pain patients often have psychological problems which accompany or stem from the physical pain and it is appropriate to include psychological treatment in the multidisciplinary approach. However, patients whose pain symptoms result from a mental condition, rather than from any physical cause, generally cannot be succesfully treated in a pain rehabilitation program.</p>","","","32",1988-09-01 00:00:00,"","",25,"<p>  09/1988 - Changed title to differentiate its scope from new &#167;35.21.1.

It is common practice to do a urinalysis prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of the evaluation and management of another related condition. The procedure includes aerobic agar-based isolation of bacteria or other cultivable organisms present, and quantification of types present based on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed significant may be subjected to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols.</p>","<p>Indications</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"">           
<li>       A patient's urinalysis is abnormal suggesting urinary tract infection, for example, abnormal microscopic (hematuria, pyuria, bacteriuria); abnormal biochemical urinalysis (positive leukocyte esterase, nitrite, protein, blood); a Gram's stain positive for microorganisms; positive bacteriuria screen by a non-culture technique; or other significant abnormality of a urinalysis. While it is not essential to evaluate a urine specimen by one of these methods before a urine culture is performed, certain clinical presentations with highly suggestive signs and symptoms may lend themselves to an antecedent urinalysis procedure where follow-up culture depends upon an initial positive or abnormal test result.</li>    
    
<li>       A patient has clinical signs and symptoms indicative of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute lower UTI may present with urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, discharge or incontinence. These findings may also be noted in upper UTI with additional systemic symptoms (for example, fever, chills, lethargy); or pain in the costovertebral, abdominal, or pelvic areas.&#160; Signs and symptoms may overlap considerably with other inflammatory conditions of the genitourinary tract (for example, prostatitis, urethritis, vaginitis, or cervicitis). Elderly or immunocompromised patients, or patients with neurologic disorders may present atypically (for example, general debility, acute mental status changes, declining functional status).</li>    
    
<li>       The patient is being evaluated for suspected urosepsis, fever of unknown origin, or other systemic manifestations of infection but without a known source. Signs and symptoms used to define sepsis have been well established.</li>    
    
<li>       A test-of cure is generally not indicated in an uncomplicated infection. However, it may be indicated if the patient is being evaluated for response to therapy and there is a complicating co-existing urinary abnormality including structural or functional abnormalities, calculi, foreign bodies, or ureteral/renal stents or there is clinical or laboratory evidence of failure to respond as described in Indications 1 and 2.</li>    
    
<li>       In surgical procedures involving major manipulations of the genitourinary tract, preoperative examination to detect occult infection may be indicated in selected cases (for example, prior to renal transplantation, manipulation or removal of kidney stones, or transurethral surgery of the bladder or prostate).</li>    
    
<li>       Urine culture may be indicated to detect occult infection in renal transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<p>       Limitations</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"">           
<li>       CPT 87086 may be used one time per encounter.</li>    
    
<li>       Colony count restrictions on coverage of CPT 87088 do not apply as they may be highly variable according to syndrome or other clinical circumstances (for example, antecedent therapy, collection time, degree of hydration).</li>    
    
<li>       CPT 87088, 87184, and 87186 may be used multiple times in association with or independent of 87086, as urinary tract infections may be polymicrobial.</li>    
    
<li>       Testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria as part of a prenatal evaluation may be medically appropriate but is considered screening and, therefore, not covered by Medicare. The US Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria outside of the narrow indication for pregnant women is generally not indicated. There are insufficient data to recommend screening in ambulatory elderly patients including those with diabetes. Testing may be clinically indicated on other grounds including likelihood of recurrence or potential adverse effects of antibiotics, but is considered screening in the absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of infection.</li>

26,1,True,2,"130.1","Inpatient Hospital Stays for Treatment of Alcoholism",1966-01-01 00:00:00,,,"","<strong><p>A. Inpatient Hospital Stay for Alcohol Detoxification</p></strong>
<p>Many hospitals provide detoxification services during the more acute stages of alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal. When the high probability or occurrence of medical complications (e.g., delirium, confusion, trauma, or unconsciousness) during detoxification for acute alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal necessitates the constant availability of physicians and/or complex medical equipment found only in the hospital setting, inpatient hospital care during this period is considered reasonable and necessary and is therefore covered under the program. Generally, detoxification can be accomplished within two to three days with an occasional need for up to five days where the patient’s condition dictates. This limit (five days) may be extended in an individual case where there is a need for a longer period for detoxification for a particular patient.</p>
<p>In such cases, however, there should be documentation by a physician which substantiates that a longer period of detoxification was reasonable and necessary. When the detoxification needs of an individual no longer require an inpatient hospital setting, coverage should be denied on the basis that inpatient hospital care is not reasonable and necessary as required by §1862(a)(l) of the Social Security Act (the Act).  Following detoxification a patient may be transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation unit or discharged to a residential treatment program or outpatient treatment setting.</p>

<strong><p>B. Inpatient Hospital Stay for Alcohol Rehabilitation</p></strong>
<p>Hospitals may also provide structured inpatient alcohol rehabilitation programs to the chronic alcoholic. These programs are composed primarily of coordinated educational and psychotherapeutic services provided on a group basis. Depending on the subject matter, a series of lectures, discussions, films, and group therapy sessions are led by either physicians, psychologists, or alcoholism counselors from the hospital or various outside organizations. In addition, individual psychotherapy and family counseling (see §70.1) may be provided in selected cases. These programs are conducted under the supervision and direction of a physician. Patients may directly enter an inpatient hospital rehabilitation program after having undergone detoxification in the same hospital or in another hospital or may enter an inpatient hospital rehabilitation program without prior hospitalization for detoxification.</p>
<p>Alcohol rehabilitation can be provided in a variety of settings other than the hospital setting. In order for an inpatient hospital stay for alcohol rehabilitation to be covered under Medicare it must be medically necessary for the care to be provided in the inpatient hospital setting rather than in a less costly facility or on an outpatient basis. Inpatient hospital care for receipt of an alcohol rehabilitation program would generally be medically necessary where either (l) there is documentation by the physician that recent alcohol rehabilitation services in a less intensive setting or on an outpatient basis have proven unsuccessful and, as a consequence, the patient requires the supervision and intensity of services which can only be found in the controlled environment of the hospital, or (2) only the hospital environment can assure the medical management or control of the patient’s concomitant conditions during the course of alcohol rehabilitation.  (However, a patient’s concomitant condition may make the use of certain alcohol treatment modalities medically inappropriate.)</p>

<p>In addition, the “active treatment” criteria (see the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 2, “Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services,” §20) should be applied to psychiatric care in the general hospital as well as to psychiatric care in a psychiatric hospital. Since alcoholism is classifiable as a psychiatric condition the “active treatment” criteria must also be met in order for alcohol rehabilitation services to be covered under Medicare. (Thus, it is the combined need for “active treatment” and for covered care which can only be provided in the inpatient hospital setting, rather than the fact that rehabilitation immediately follows a period of detoxification which provides the basis for coverage of inpatient hospital alcohol rehabilitation programs.)</p>
<p>Generally 16-19 days of rehabilitation services are sufficient to bring a patient to a point where care could be continued in other than an inpatient hospital setting. An inpatient hospital stay for alcohol rehabilitation may be extended beyond this limit in an individual case where a longer period of alcohol rehabilitation is medically necessary. In such cases, however, there should be documentation by a physician which substantiates the need for such care. Where the rehabilitation needs of an individual no longer require an inpatient hospital setting, coverage should be denied on the basis that inpatient hospital care is not reasonable and necessary as required by §1862 (a)(l) of the Act.</p>
<p>Subsequent admissions to the inpatient hospital setting for alcohol rehabilitation follow-up, reinforcement, or “recap” treatments are considered to be readmissions (rather than an extension of the original stay) and must meet the requirements of this section for coverage under Medicare. Prior admissions to the inpatient hospital setting - either in the same hospital or in a different hospital - may be an indication that the “active treatment” requirements are not met (i.e., there is no reasonable expectation of improvement) and the stay should not be covered. Accordingly, there should be documentation to establish that “readmission” to the hospital setting for alcohol rehabilitation services can reasonably be expected to result in improvement of the patient’s condition. For example, the documentation should indicate what changes in the patient’s medical condition, social or emotional status, or treatment plan make improvement likely, or why the patient’s initial hospital treatment was not sufficient.</p>

<strong><p>C. Combined Alcohol Detoxification/Rehabilitation Programs</p></strong>
<p>Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) should apply the guidelines in A. and B. above to both phases of a combined inpatient hospital alcohol detoxification/rehabilitation program. Not all patients who require the inpatient hospital setting for detoxification also need the inpatient hospital setting for rehabilitation. (See §<a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=26&ncdver=1&DocID=130.1&kq=true&SearchType=Advanced&bc=EAAAAAgAAAAA&"">130.1</a> for coverage of outpatient hospital alcohol rehabilitation services.) Where the inpatient hospital setting is medically necessary for both alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation, generally a 3-week period is reasonable and necessary to bring the patient to the point where care can be continued in other than an inpatient hospital setting.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding reasonableness and necessity of treatment, the need for an inpatient hospital level of care, and length of treatment should be made by A/MACs based on accepted medical practice with the advice of their medical consultant. (In hospitals under PSRO review, PSRO determinations of medical necessity of services and appropriateness of the level of care at which services are provided are binding on A/MACs for purposes of adjudicating claims for payment.)</p>","","","",,"","",25,"",False,2002-12-12 08:24:20,2020-06-16 15:13:28,2002-12-12 09:36:16,False,"Alcoholism treatment, IPH Stays",False

Chemical aversion therapy facilitates alcohol abstinence through the development of conditioned aversions to the taste, smell, and sight of alcohol beverages. This is accomplished by repeatedly pairing alcohol with unpleasant symptoms (e.g., nausea) which have been induced by one of several chemical agents. While a number of drugs have been employed in chemical aversion therapy, the three most commonly used are emetine, apomorphine, and lithium. None of the drugs being used, however, have yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for use in chemical aversion therapy for alcoholism. Accordingly, when these drugs are being employed in conjunction with this therapy, patients undergoing this treatment need to be kept under medical observation.</p>","<p>Available evidence indicates that chemical aversion therapy may be an effective component of certain alcoholism treatment programs, particularly as part of multi-modality treatment programs which include other behavioral techniques and therapies, such as psychotherapy. Based on this evidence, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ medical consultants have recommended that chemical aversion therapy be covered under Medicare. However, since chemical aversion therapy is a demanding therapy which may not be appropriate for all Medicare beneficiaries needing treatment for alcoholism, a physician should certify to the appropriateness of chemical aversion therapy in the individual case. Therefore, if chemical aversion therapy for treatment of alcoholism is determined to be reasonable and necessary for an individual patient, it is covered under Medicare.</p>
<p>When it is medically necessary for a patient to receive chemical aversion therapy as a hospital inpatient, coverage for care in that setting is available. (See &sect;130.1 regarding coverage of multi-modality treatment programs.) Follow-up treatments for chemical aversion therapy can generally be provided on an outpatient basis. Thus, where a patient is admitted as an inpatient for receipt of chemical aversion therapy, there must be documentation by the physician of the need in the individual case for the inpatient hospital admission.</p>

These symptoms in patients result from reduction in blood flow to the brain and range from symptoms of transient basilar ischemia to mental deterioration or completed stroke.</p>

<p> Five types of surgical procedures are performed to relieve obstructions to vertebral artery blood flow. They are:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Vertebral artery endarterectomy, a procedure which cleans out arteriosclerotic plaques which are inside the vertebral artery;</li>

<li> Vertebral artery by-pass or resection with anastomosis or graft;</li>

<li> Subclavian artery resection with or without endarterectomy;</li>

<li> Removal of laterally located osteophytes anywhere in the C6(C7)-C2 course of the vertebral artery; and</li>

<li> Arteriolysis which frees the artery from surrounding tissue, with or without arteriopexy (fixation of the vessel).</li>
</ul>","<p> These procedures can be medically reasonable and necessary, but only if each of the following conditions is met:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction exist;</li>

<li> Other causes have been considered and ruled out;</li>

<li> There is radiographic evidence of a valid vertebral artery obstruction; and</li>

<li> Contraindications to the procedure do not exist, such as coexistent obstructions of multiple cerebral vessels.</li>
</ul>

<p> Angiograms documenting a valid obstruction should show not only the aortic arch with the vessels off the arch, but also show the vessels in the neck and head (providing biplane views of the carotid and vertebral vascular system). In addition, serial views are needed to diagnose ""subclavian steal,"" the condition in which subclavian artery obstruction causes the symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction. Because the symptoms are not specific for vertebral artery obstruction, other causes must be considered. In addition to vertebral artery obstruction, the differential diagnosis should include various degenerative disorders of the brain, orthostatic hypotension, acoustic neuroma, labyrinthitis, diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemia related disorders.</p>

<p> Obstructions which can cause symptoms of blocked vertebral artery blood flow and which can be documented by an angiogram include:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Intravascular obstructions - arteriosclerotic lesions within the vertebral artery or in other arteries.</li>

<li> Extravascular obstructions.</li>

<li> Bony tissue or osteophytes, located laterally in the C6(C7)-C2 cervical vertebral area course of the vertebral artery, most commonly at C5 -C6.</li>

<li> Anatomical variations - Anomalous location of the origin of the vertebral artery, a congenital aberration, and tortuosity and kinks of the vertebral artery.</li>

<li> Fibrous tissue - Tissue changed as a result of manipulation of the neck for neck pain or injury associated with hematoma; external bands, tendinous slings, and fibrous bands.</li>
</ul>

<p> The most controversial obstructions include vertebral artery tortuosity and kinks and connective tissue along the course of the vertebral artery, and variously called external bands, tendinous slings and fibrous bands. In the absence of symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction, vascular surgeons feel such abnormalities are insignificant. Vascular surgery experts, however, agree that these abnormalities in very rare cases do cause symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction and do necessitate surgical correction.</p>

<p> Vertebral artery construction and vertebral artery surgery are phrases which most physicians interpret to include only surgical cleaning (endarterectomy) and bypass (resection) procedures. However, some physicians who use these terms mean all operative manipulations which remove vertebral artery blood flow obstructions. Also, some physicians use general terms of vascular surgery, such as endarterectomy when vertebral artery related surgery is performed. Use of the above terminology specifies neither the surgical procedure performed nor its relationship to the vertebral artery. Therefore, in developing claims for this type of procedure, require specific identification of the obstruction in question and the surgical procedure performed. Also, in view of the specific coverage criteria given, develop all claims for vertebral artery surgery on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p> Make payment for a surgical procedure listed above if: (1)&#160;it is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient to have the surgery performed to remove or relieve an obstruction to vertebral artery flow, and (2)&#160;the four conditions noted are met.</p>

These assays take one of two forms: antibody detection assays and specific HIV antigen (p24) procedures.  The antibody assays are usually enzyme immunoassays (EIA) which are used to confirm exposure of an individual's immune system to specific viral antigens. These assays may be formatted to detect HIV-1, HIV-2, or HIV-1 and 2 simultaneously and to detect both IgM and IgG.  When the initial EIA test is repeatedly positive or indeterminant, an alternative test is used to confirm the specificity of the antibodies to individual viral components.  The most commonly used method is the Western Blot.</p>    
    
<p>The HIV-1 core antigen (p24) test detects circulating viral antigen which may be found prior to the development of antibodies and may also be present in later stages of illness in the form of recurrent or persistent antigenemia.  Its prognostic utility in HIV infection has been diminished as a result of development of sensitive viral RNA assays, and its primary use today is as a routine screening tool in potential blood donors.</p>    
    
<p>In several unique situations, serologic testing alone may not reliably establish an HIV infection.  This may occur because the antibody response (particularly the IgG response detected by Western Blot) has not yet developed (that is, acute retroviral syndrome), or is persistently equivocal because of inherent viral antigen variability.  It is also an issue in perinatal HIV infection due to transplacental passage of maternal HIV antibody.  In these situations, laboratory evidence of HIV in blood by culture, antigen assays, or proviral DNA or viral RNA assays, is required to establish a definitive determination of HIV infection.</p>","<p> <strong>Indications</strong></p>    
    
<p> Diagnostic testing to establish HIV infection may be indicated when there is a strong clinical suspicion supported by one or more of the following clinical findings:</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"">     
<li> The patient has a documented, otherwise unexplained, AIDS-defining or AIDS-associated opportunistic infection.</li>    
    
<li> The patient has another documented sexually transmitted disease which identifies significant risk of exposure to HIV and the potential for an early or subclinical infection.</li>    
    
<li> The patient has documented acute or chronic hepatitis B or C infection that identifies a significant risk of exposure to HIV and the potential for an early or subclinical infection.</li>    
    
<li> The patient has a documented AIDS-defining or AIDS-associated neoplasm.</li>    
    
<li> The patient has a documented AIDS-associated neurologic disorder or otherwise unexplained dementia.</li>    
    
<li> The patient has another documented AIDS-defining clinical condition, or a history of other severe, recurrent, or persistent conditions which suggest an underlying immune deficiency (for example, cutaneous or mucosal disorders).</li>    
    
<li> The patient has otherwise unexplained generalized signs and symptoms suggestive of a chronic process with an underlying immune deficiency (for example, fever, weight loss, malaise, fatigue, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, chronic cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, or lymphadenopathy).</li>    
    
<li> The patient has otherwise unexplained laboratory evidence of a chronic disease process with an underlying immune deficiency (for example, anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, lymphopenia, or low CD4+ lymphocyte count).</li>    
    
<li> The patient has signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash.</li>    
    
<li> The patient has documented exposure to blood or body fluids known to be capable of transmitting HIV (for example, needle sticks and other significant blood exposures) and antiviral therapy is initiated or anticipated to be initiated.</li>    
    
<li> The patient is undergoing treatment for rape.&#160; (HIV testing is a part of the rape treatment protocol.)</li>    
</ol>    
    
<p> <strong>Limitations</strong></p>    
    
<ol start=""1"">     
<li> HIV antibody testing in the United States is usually performed using HIV-1 or HIV-&#189; combination tests.&#160; HIV-2 testing is indicated if clinical circumstances suggest HIV-2 is likely (that is, compatible clinical findings and HIV-1 test negative).&#160; HIV-2 testing may also be indicated in areas of the country where there is greater prevalence of HIV-2 infections.</li>    
    
<li> The Western Blot test should be performed only after documentation that the initial EIA tests are repeatedly positive or equivocal on a single sample.</li>    
    
<li> The HIV antigen tests currently have no defined diagnostic usage.</li>    
    
<li> Direct viral RNA detection may be performed in those situations where serologic testing does not establish a diagnosis but strong clinical suspicion persists (for example, acute retroviral syndrome, nonspecific serologic evidence of HIV, or perinatal HIV infection).</li>    
    
<li> If initial serologic tests confirm an HIV infection, repeat testing is not indicated.</li>    
    
<li> If initial serologic tests are HIV EIA negative and there is no indication for confirmation of infection by viral RNA detection, the interval prior to retesting is 3-6 months.</li>    
    
<li> Testing for evidence of HIV infection using serologic methods may be medically appropriate in situations where there is a risk of exposure to HIV.</li>    
    
<li> The CPT Editorial Panel has issued a number of codes for infectious agent detection by direct antigen or nucleic acid probe techniques that have not yet been developed or are only being used on an investigational basis.&#160; Laboratory providers are advised to remain current on FDA-approval status for these tests.</li>

55,1,True,2,"110.15","Ultrafiltration, Hemoperfusion and Hemofiltration",1987-08-20 00:00:00,,,"<strong><p>A.  Ultrafiltration</p></strong>

<p> This is a process for removing excess fluid from the blood through the dialysis membrane by means of pressure. It is not a substitute for dialysis. Ultrafiltration is utilized in cases where excess fluid cannot be removed easily during the regular course of hemodialysis. When it is performed, it is commonly done during the first hour or two of each hemodialysis on patients who, e.g., have refractory edema. Ultrafiltration is a covered procedure under the Medicare program&#160; (effective for services performed on and after September 1, 1979).</p>

<p> Predialysis Ultrafiltration</p>

<p> While the predialysis ultrafiltration procedure requires additional staff care, the facility dialysis rate is intended to cover the full range of complicated and uncomplicated nonacute dialysis treatments. Therefore, no additional facility charge is recognized for predialysis ultrafiltration. The physician's role in ultrafiltration varies with the stability of the patient's condition. In unstable patients, the physician may need to be present at the initiation of dialysis, and available either in- house or in close proximity to monitor the patient carefully. In patients who are relatively stable, but who seem to accumulate excessive weight gain, the procedure requires only a modest increase in physician involvement over routine outpatient hemodialysis.</p>

<p> Occasionally, medical complications may occur which require that ultrafiltration be performed separate from the dialysis treatment, and in these cases an additional charge can be recognized. However, the claim must be documented as to why the ultrafiltration could not have been performed at the same time as the dialysis.</p>","<strong><p>B.  Hemoperfusion</p></strong>

<p> This is a process which removes substances from the blood using a charcoal or resin artificial kidney. When used in the treatment of life threatening drug overdose, hemoperfusion is a covered service for patients with or without renal failure. Hemoperfusion generally requires a physician to be present to initiate treatment and to be present in the hospital or an adjacent medical office during the entire procedure, as changes may be sudden. Special staff training and equipment are required.</p>

<p> Develop charges for hemoperfusion in the same manner as for any new or unusual service. One or two treatments are usually all that is necessary to remove the toxic compound; document additional treatments. Hemoperfusion may be performed concurrently with dialysis, and in those cases payment for the hemoperfusion reflects only the additional care rendered over and above the care given with dialysis.</p>

<p> The effects of using hemoperfusion to improve the results of chronic hemodialysis are not known. Therefore, hemoperfusion is not a covered service when used to improve the results of hemodialysis. In addition, it has not been demonstrated that the use of hemoperfusion in conjunction with deferoxamine (DFO), in treating symptomatic patients with iron overload, is efficacious. There is also a paucity of data regarding its efficacy in treating asymptomatic patients with iron overload. Therefore, hemoperfusion used in conjunction with DFO in treating patients with iron overload is not a covered service; i.e., it is not considered reasonable and necessary within the meaning of &#167;1862(a)(1) of the Act.</p>

<p> However, the use of hemoperfusion in conjunction with DFO for the treatment of patients with aluminum toxicity has been demonstrated to be clinically efficacious and is therefore regarded as a covered service.</p>

<strong><p>C.  Hemofiltration</p></strong>

<p> This is a process which removes fluid, electrolytes and other low molecular weight toxic substances from the blood by filtration through hollow artificial membranes and may be routinely performed in 3 weekly sessions. Hemofiltration (which is also known as diafiltration) is a covered procedure under Medicare and is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of ESRD patients and an alternative to peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. In contrast to both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatments, which eliminate dissolved substances via diffusion across semipermeable membranes, hemofiltration mimics the filtration process of the normal kidney. The technique requires an arteriovenous access. Hemofiltration may be performed either in facility or at home.</p>

<p><strong>A. General</strong></p>   
 
<p>Obesity may be caused by medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's disease, and hypothalamic lesions, or can aggravate a number of cardiac and respiratory diseases as well as diabetes and hypertension. Non-surgical services in connection with the treatment of obesity are covered when such services are an integral and necessary part of a course of treatment for one of these medical conditions.</p>   
 
<p>In addition, supplemented fasting is a type of very low calorie weight reduction regimen used to achieve rapid weight loss. The reduced calorie intake is supplemented by a mixture of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Serious questions exist about the safety of prolonged adherence for 2 months or more to a very low calorie weight reduction regimen as a general treatment for obesity, because of instances of cardiopathology and sudden death, as well as possible loss of body protein.</p>   
 
<p>Bariatric surgery procedures are performed to treat comorbid conditions associated with morbid obesity. Two types of surgical procedures are employed. Malabsorptive procedures divert food from the stomach to a lower part of the digestive tract where the normal mixing of digestive fluids and absorption of nutrients cannot occur. Restrictive procedures restrict the size of the stomach and decrease intake. Surgery can combine both types of procedures.</p>   
 
<p>The following are descriptions of bariatric surgery procedures:</p>   
 
<p>1. Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGBP)</p>   
 
<p>The RYGBP achieves weight loss by gastric restriction and malabsorption. Reduction of the stomach to a small gastric pouch (30 cc) results in feelings of satiety following even small meals. This small pouch is connected to a segment of the jejunum, bypassing the duodenum and very proximal small intestine, thereby reducing absorption. RYGBP procedures can be open or laparoscopic.</p>   
 
<p>2. Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) or Gastric Reduction Duodenal Switch (BPD/GRDS)</p>   
   
<p>The BPD achieves weight loss by gastric restriction and malabsorption. The stomach is partially resected, but the remaining capacity is generous compared to that achieved with RYGBP. As such, patients eat relatively normal-sized meals and do not need to restrict intake radically, since the most proximal areas of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum and jejunum) are bypassed, and substantial malabsorption occurs. The partial BPD/DS or BPD/GRDS is a variant of the BPD procedure. It involves resection of the greater curvature of the stomach, preservation of the pyloric sphincter, and transection of the duodenum above the ampulla of Vater with a duodeno-ileal anastomosis and a lower ileo-ileal anastomosis. BPD/DS or BPD/GRDS procedures can be open or laparoscopic.</p>   
 
<p>3. Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB)</p>   
 
<p>The AGB achieves weight loss by gastric restriction only. A band creating a gastric pouch with a capacity of approximately 15 to 30 cc's encircles the uppermost portion of the stomach. The band is an inflatable doughnut-shaped balloon, the diameter of which can be adjusted in the clinic by adding or removing saline via a port that is positioned beneath the skin. The bands are adjustable, allowing the size of the gastric outlet  to be modified as needed, depending on the rate of a patient's weight loss. AGB procedures are laparoscopic only.</p>   
 
<p>4. Sleeve Gastrectomy</p>   
 
<p>Sleeve gastrectomy is a 70%-80% greater curvature gastrectomy (sleeve resection of the stomach) with continuity of the gastric lesser curve being maintained while simultaneously reducing stomach volume. In the past, sleeve gastrectomy was the first step in a two-stage procedure when performing RYGBP, but more recently has been offered as a stand-alone surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy procedures can be open or laparoscopic.</p>   
 
<p>5. Vertical Gastric Banding (VGB)</p>   
 
<p>The VGB achieves weight loss by gastric restriction only. The upper part of the stomach is stapled, creating a narrow gastric inlet or pouch that remains connected with the remainder of the stomach. In addition, a non-adjustable band is placed around this new inlet in an attempt to prevent future enlargement of the stoma (opening). As a result, patients experience a sense of fullness after eating small meals. Weight loss from this procedure results entirely from eating less. VGB procedures are essentially no longer performed.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>   
 
<p>Effective for services performed on and after February 21, 2006, Open and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), open and laparoscopic Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) or Gastric Reduction Duodenal Switch (BPD/GRDS), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) are covered for Medicare beneficiaries who have a body-mass index &ge; 35, have at least one co-morbidity related to obesity, and have been previously unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity.</p>   
   
<p>Effective for dates of service on and after February 21, 2006, these procedures are only covered when performed at facilities that are: (1) certified by the American College of Surgeons as a Level 1 Bariatric Surgery Center (program standards and requirements in effect on February 15, 2006); or (2) certified by the American Society for Bariatric Surgery as a Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence (program standards and requirements in effect on February 15, 2006). Effective for dates of service on and after September 24, 2013, facilities are no longer required to be certified.</p>

<p>Intestinal bypass surgery; and,</p>   
<p>Gastric balloon for treatment of obesity.</p></div>   
 
<p><strong>D. Other</strong></p>   
 
<p>Effective for services performed on and after June 27, 2012, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) acting within their respective jurisdictions may determine coverage of stand-alone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for the treatment of co-morbid conditions related to obesity in Medicare beneficiaries only when all of the following conditions a.-c. are satisfied.</p>   
 
<ol type=""a""> 
	<li>The beneficiary has a body-mass index (BMI) &ge; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,  </li>

	<li>The beneficiary has been previously unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity.  </li> 
</ol> 
  
<p>The determination of coverage for any bariatric surgery procedures that are not specifically identified in an NCD as covered or non-covered, for Medicare beneficiaries who have a body-mass index &ge; 35, have at least one co-morbidity related to obesity, and have been previously unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity, is left to the local MACs.</p>   
 
<p>Where weight loss is necessary before surgery in order to ameliorate the complications posed by obesity when it coexists with pathological conditions such as cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes, or hypertension (and other more conservative techniques to achieve this end are not regarded as appropriate), supplemented fasting with adequate monitoring of the patient is eligible for coverage on a case-by-case basis or pursuant to a local coverage determination. The risks associated with the achievement of rapid weight loss must be carefully balanced against the risk posed by the condition requiring surgical treatment.</p>","","","158",2013-12-23 00:00:00,"http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/downloads/R158NCD.pdf","8484",25,"<p>03/2025 - The purpose of this Change Request (CR) is to provide a quarterly maintenance update of ICD-10 coding conversions and other coding updates specific to National Coverage Determinations (NCDs).

<p> Cataract surgery with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is a high volume Medicare procedure. Along with the surgery, a substantial number of preoperative tests are available to the surgeon. In most cases, a comprehensive eye examination (ocular history and ocular examination) and a single scan to determine the appropriate pseudophakic power of the IOL are sufficient. In most cases involving a simple cataract, a diagnostic ultrasound A-scan is used. For patients with a dense cataract, an ultrasound B-scan may be used.</p>

<p> Accordingly, where the only diagnosis is cataract(s), Medicare does not routinely cover testing other than one comprehensive eye examination (or a combination of a brief/intermediate examination not to exceed the charge of a comprehensive examination) and an A-scan or, if medically justified, a B-scan. Claims for additional tests are denied as not reasonable and necessary unless there is an additional diagnosis and the medical need for the additional tests is fully documented.</p>

<p> Because cataract surgery is an elective procedure, the patient may decide not to have the surgery until later, or to have the surgery performed by a physician other than the diagnosing physician. In these situations, it may be medically appropriate for the operating physician to conduct another examination.

These include primary disorders such as anemia, leukemia, polycythemia, thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Many other conditions secondarily affect the blood or bone marrow, including reaction to inflammation and infections, coagulopathies, neoplasms and exposure to toxic substances. Many treatments and therapies affect the blood or bone marrow, and blood counts may be used to monitor treatment effects.</p>

<p>The symptoms of hematological disorders are often nonspecific, and are commonly encountered in patients who may or may not prove to have a disorder of the blood or bone marrow. Furthermore, many medical conditions that are not primarily due to abnormalities of blood or bone marrow may have hematological manifestations that result from the disease or its treatment. As a result, the CBC is one of the most commonly indicated laboratory tests.</p>     
     
<p>Inpatients with possible hematological abnormalities, it may be necessary to determine the hemoglobin and hematocrit, to calculate the red cell indices, and to measure the concentration of white blood cells and platelets.

<ol start=""1"">     
<li>Indications for a CBC generally include the evaluation of bone marrow dysfunction as a result of neoplasms, therapeutic agents, exposure to toxic substances, or pregnancy.&#160; The CBC is also useful in assessing peripheral destruction of blood cells, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic, or lymphoproliferative processes, and immune disorders.</li>   <br>
     
<li>Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease that can be associated with anemia or other red blood cell disorder (e.g., pallor, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, bleeding, acute injury associated with blood loss or suspected blood loss, abnormal menstrual bleeding, hematuria, hematemesis, hematochezia, positive fecal occult blood test, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, malabsorption, neuropathy, known malignancy, presence of acute or chronic disease that may have associated anemia, coagulation or hemostatic disorders, postural dizziness, syncope, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, chronic marrow hypoplasia or decreased RBC production, tachycardia, systolic heart murmur, congestive heart failure, dyspnea, angina, nailbed deformities, growth retardation, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, ulcers on the lower extremities).</li>      <br>
     
<li>Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease that can be associated with polycythemia (for example, fever, chills, ruddy skin, conjunctival redness, cough, wheezing, cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, orthopnea, heart murmur, headache, vague cognitive changes including memory changes, sleep apnea, weakness, pruritus, dizziness, excessive sweating, visual symptoms, weight loss, massive obesity, gastrointestinal bleeding, paresthesias, dyspnea, joint symptoms, epigastric distress, pain and erythema of the fingers or toes, venous or arterial thrombosis, thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, congenital heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, increased erythropoietin production associated with neoplastic, renal or hepatic disorders, androgen or diuretic use, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, diastolic hypertension.)</li>      <br>
     
<li>Specific indications for CBC with differential count related to the WBC include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease associated with leukemia, infections or inflammatory processes, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic or lymphoproliferative disorder, use of drugs that may cause leukopenia, and immune disorders (e.g., fever, chills, sweats, shock, fatigue, malaise, tachycardia, tachypnea, heart murmur, seizures, alterations of consciousness, meningismus, pain such as headache, abdominal pain, arthralgia, odynophagia, or dysuria, redness or swelling of skin, soft tissue bone, or joint, ulcers of the skin or mucous membranes, gangrene, mucous membrane discharge, bleeding, thrombosis, respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrate, jaundice, diarrhea, vomiting, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, opportunistic infection such as oral candidiasis.)</li>      <br>
     
<li>Specific indications for CBC related to the platelet count include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease associated with increased or decreased platelet production and destruction, or platelet dysfunction(e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, genitourinary tract bleeding, bilateral epistaxis, thrombosis, ecchymosis, purpura, jaundice, petechiae, fever, heparin therapy, suspected DIC, shock, pre-eclampsia, neonate with maternal ITP, massive transfusion, recent platelet transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, hemolytic uremic syndrome, renal diseases, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hypersplenism, neurologic abnormalities, viral or other infection, myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic, or lymphoproliferative disorder, thrombosis, exposure to toxic agents, excessive alcohol ingestion, autoimmune disorders (SLE, RA and other).</li>      <br>
     
<li>Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters of the hemogram include, in addition to those already listed, thalassemia, suspected hemoglobinopathy, lead poisoning, arsenic poisoning, and spherocytosis.</li>      <br>
     
<li>Specific indications for CBC with differential count related to the WBC include, in addition to those already listed, storage diseases/mucopolysaccharidoses, and use of drugs that cause leukocytosis such as G-CSF or GM-CSF.</li>      <br>
     
<li>Specific indications for CBC related to platelet count include, in addition to those already listed, May-Hegglin syndrome and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</li>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>     
     
<ol start=""1"">     
<li>Testing of patients who are asymptomatic, or who do not have a condition that could be expected to result in a hematological abnormality, is screening and is not a covered service.</li>      <br>
     
<li>In some circumstances it may be appropriate to perform only a hemoglobin or hematocrit to assess the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. When the ordering provider requests only a hemoglobin or hematocrit, the remaining components of the CBC are not covered.</li>   <br>   
     
<li>When a blood count is performed for an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient, and is billed outside the ESRD rate, documentation of the medical necessity for the blood count must be submitted with the claim.</li>     
      <br>
<li>In some patients presenting with certain signs, symptoms or diseases, a single CBC may be appropriate. Repeat testing may not be indicated unless abnormal results are found, or unless there is a change in clinical condition. If repeat testing is performed, a more descriptive diagnosis code (e.g., anemia) should be reported to support medical necessity. However, repeat testing may be indicated where results are normal in patients with conditions where there is a continued risk for the development of hematologic abnormality.</li>

<p>  Accordingly, program payment may be made for the following techniques when used to determine the potential therapeutic usefulness of an electrical nerve stimulator:</p> 
 
<p>  <strong>  A. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</strong></p> 
 
<p>  This technique involves attachment of a transcutaneous nerve stimulator to the surface of the skin over the peripheral nerve to be stimulated. It is used by the patient on a trial basis and its effectiveness in modulating pain is monitored by the physician, or physical therapist. Generally, the physician or physical therapist is able to determine whether the patient is likely to derive a significant therapeutic benefit from continuous use of a transcutaneous stimulator within a trial period of 1 month; in a few cases this determination may take longer to make. Document the medical necessity for such services which are furnished beyond the first month. (See &#167;<a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=151&ncdver=1&DocID=160.13&bc=gAAAAAgAAAAA&"">160.13</a> for an explanation of coverage of medically necessary supplies for the effective use of TENS.)</p> 
 
<p>  If TENS significantly alleviates pain, it may be considered as primary treatment; if it produces no relief or greater discomfort than the original pain electrical nerve stimulation therapy is ruled out. However, where TENS produces incomplete relief, further evaluation with percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be considered to determine whether an implanted peripheral nerve stimulator would provide significant relief from pain.</p> 
 
<p>  Usually, the physician or physical therapist providing the services will furnish the equipment necessary for assessment. Where the physician or physical therapist advises the patient to rent the TENS from a supplier during the trial period rather than supplying it himself/herself, program payment may be made for rental of the TENS as well as for the services of the physician or physical therapist who is evaluating its use. However, the combined program payment which is made for the physician's or physical therapist's services and the rental of the stimulator from a supplier should not exceed the amount which would be payable for the total service, including the stimulator, furnished by the physician or physical therapist alone.</p> 
 
<p>  <strong>  B. Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS)</strong></p> 
 
<p>  This diagnostic procedure which involves stimulation of peripheral nerves by a needle electrode inserted through the skin is performed only in a physician's office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department. Therefore, it is covered only when performed by a physician or incident to physician's service. If pain is effectively controlled by percutaneous stimulation, implantation of electrodes is warranted.</p> 
 
<p>  As in the case of TENS (described in subsection A), generally the physician should be able to determine whether the patient is likely to derive a significant therapeutic benefit from continuing use of an implanted nerve stimulator within a trial period of 1 month. In a few cases, this determination may take longer to make. The medical necessity for such diagnostic services which are furnished beyond the first month must be documented.</p> 
 
<p>  <strong>  NOTE:</strong> Electrical nerve stimulators do not prevent pain but only alleviate pain as it occurs. A patient can be taught how to employ the stimulator, and once this is done, can use it safely and effectively without direct physician supervision. Consequently, it is inappropriate for a patient to visit his/her physician, physical therapist, or an outpatient clinic on a continuing basis for treatment of pain with electrical nerve stimulation. Once it is determined that electrical nerve stimulation should be continued as therapy and the patient has been trained to use the stimulator, it is expected that a stimulator will be implanted or the patient will employ the TENS on a continual basis in his/her home. Electrical nerve stimulation treatments furnished by a physician in his/her office, by a physical therapist or outpatient clinic are excluded from coverage by &#167;1862(a)(1) of the Act.

<p>      <strong>   A. General</strong></p>

<p>   Electrical stimulation to augment bone repair can be attained either invasively or non-invasively. Invasive devices provide electrical stimulation directly at the fracture site either through percutaneously placed cathodes or by implantation of a coiled cathode wire into the fracture site. The power pack for the latter device is implanted into soft tissue near the fracture site and subcutaneously connected to the cathode, creating a self-contained system with no external components. The power supply for the former device is externally placed and the leads connected to the inserted cathodes. With the non-invasive device, opposing pads, wired to an external power supply, are placed over the cast. An electromagnetic field is created between the pads at the fracture site.</p>

<p>      <strong>   Ultrasonic Osteogenic Stimulators</strong></p>

<p>      <strong>   A. General</strong></p>

<p>   An ultrasonic osteogenic stimulator is a noninvasive device that emits low intensity, pulsed ultrasound. The    device is applied to the    surface of the skin at the fracture    site and ultrasound    waves are emitted via a conductive    coupling gel to stimulate fracture healing. The ultrasonic osteogenic stimulators are not be used concurrently with other non-invasive osteogenic devices.</p>","<p><strong>   Electrical Osteogenic Stimulators</strong></p>

<p><strong>   Ultrasonic Osteogenic Stimulators</strong></p>

<p><strong>   B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>Effective January 1, 2001, ultrasonic osteogenic stimulators are covered as medically reasonable and necessary for the treatment of nonunion fractures. In demonstrating non-union fractures, CMS expects:</p>

<ul>   
<li>   A minimum of 2 sets of radiographs, obtained prior to starting treatment with the osteogenic stimulator, separated by a minimum of 90 days. Each radiograph set must include multiple views of the fracture site accompanied with a written interpretation by a physician stating that there has been no clinically significant evidence of fracture healing between the 2 sets of radiographs; and,</li>

<li>   Indications that the patient failed at least one surgical intervention for the treatment of the fracture.</li>

<li>Effective April 27, 2005, upon reconsideration of ultrasound stimulation for nonunion fracture healing, CMS determines that the evidence is adequate to conclude that noninvasive ultrasound stimulation for the treatment of nonunion bone fractures prior to surgical intervention is reasonable and necessary. In demonstrating non-union fractures, CMS expects:</li>

<li>   A minimum of 2 sets of radiographs, obtained prior to starting treatment with the osteogenic stimulator, separated by a minimum of 90 days. Each radiograph set must include multiple views of the fracture site accompanied with a written interpretation by a physician stating that there has been no clinically significant evidence of fracture healing between the 2 sets of radiographs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>   C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>   Nonunion fractures of the skull, vertebrae and those that are tumor-related are excluded from coverage.</p>

<p>Liver transplantation, which is in situ replacement of a patient’s liver with a donor liver, in certain circumstances, may be an accepted treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease due to a variety of causes. The procedure is used in selected patients as a treatment for malignancies, including primary liver tumors and certain metastatic tumors, which are typically rare but lethal with very limited treatment options. It has also been used in the treatment of patients with extrahepatic perihilar malignancies. Examples of malignancies include extrahepatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), liver metastases due to a neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and, hemangioendothelioma (HAE). Despite potential short- and long-term complications, transplantation may offer the only chance of cure for selected patients while providing meaningful palliation for some others.</p>","<br><strong><p>B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>      
 
<p>Effective July 15, 1996, adult liver transplantation when performed on beneficiaries with end- stage liver disease other than hepatitis B or malignancies is covered under Medicare when performed in a facility which is approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as meeting institutional coverage criteria.</p>      
      
<p>Effective December 10, 1999, adult liver transplantation when performed on beneficiaries with end-stage liver disease other than malignancies is covered under Medicare when performed in a facility which is approved by CMS as meeting institutional coverage criteria.</p>    
   
<p>Effective September 1, 2001, Medicare covers adult liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma when the following conditions are met:</p>      
<ul>      
	<li>The patient is not a candidate for subtotal liver resection;</li>      
	<li>The patient’s tumor(s) is less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter;</li>      
	<li>There is no macrovascular involvement;</li>      
	<li>There is no identifiable extrahepatic spread of tumor to surrounding lymph nodes, lungs, abdominal organs or bone; and,</li>      
	<li>The transplant is furnished in a facility that is approved by CMS as meeting institutional coverage criteria for liver transplants (see 65 FR 15006).</li>      
</ul>    
   
<p>Effective June 21, 2012, Medicare Adminstrative Contractors acting within their respective jurisdictions may determine coverage of adult liver transplantation for the following malignancies: (1) extrahepatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA); (2) liver metastases due to a neuroendocrine tumor (NET); and, (3) hemangioendothelioma (HAE).</p> 
      
<p>1. Follow-Up Care</p>      
 
<p>Follow-up care or re-transplantation required as a result of a covered liver transplant is covered, provided such services are otherwise reasonable and necessary. Follow-up care is also covered for patients who have been discharged from a hospital after receiving non-covered liver transplant. Coverage for follow-up care is for items and services that are reasonable and necessary as determined by Medicare guidelines.</p>

<ol start=""1"">    
<li>The PTT is most commonly used to quantitate the effect of therapeutic unfractionated heparin and to regulate its dosing.

PT and PTT must be justified separately.</li>    
    
<li>A PTT may be used to assess patients with signs or symptoms of hemorrhage or thrombosis. For example: abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage or hematoma petechiae or other signs of thrombocytopenia that could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation; swollen extremity with or without prior trauma.</li>    
    
<li>A PTT may be useful in evaluating patients who have a history of a condition known to be associated with the risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis that is related to the intrinsic coagulation pathway.&#160; Such abnormalities may be genetic or acquired. For example: dysfibrinogenemia; afibrinogenemia (complete); acute or chronic liver dysfunction or failure, including Wilson's disease; hemophilia; liver disease and failure; infectious processes; bleeding disorders; disseminated intravascular coagulation; lupus erythematosus or other conditions associated with circulating inhibitors, e.g., Factor VIII Inhibitor, lupus-like anticoagulant, etc.; sepsis; von Willebrand's disease; arterial and venous thrombosis, including the evaluation of hypercoagulable states; clinical conditions associated with nephrosis or renal failure; other acquired and congenital coagulopathies as well as thrombotic states.</li>    
    
<li>A PTT may be used to assess the risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage in patients who are going to have a medical intervention known to be associated with increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis. An example is as follows: evaluation prior to invasive procedures or operations of patients with personal or family history of bleeding or who are on heparin therapy.</li>

<strong><p>Limitations</p>    </strong> 
    
<ol start=""1"">

However, a PTT may be ordered on a patient being treated with warfarin as heparin therapy is being discontinued. A PTT may also be indicated when the PT is markedly prolonged due to warfarin toxicity.</li>    
    
<li>The need to repeat this test is determined by changes in the underlying medical condition and/or the dosing of heparin.</li>    
    
<li>Testing prior to any medical intervention associated with a risk of bleeding and thrombosis (other than thrombolytic therapy) will generally be considered medically necessary only where there are signs or symptoms of a bleeding or thrombotic abnormality or a personal history of bleeding, thrombosis or a condition associated with a coagulopathy.

When testing is performed to evaluate a patient with signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis and the initial test result is normal, it is ordinarily not necessary to repeat testing unless there is a change in the patient's medical status.</li>    
    
<li> Since the INR is a calculation, it will not be paid in addition to the PT when expressed in seconds, and is considered part of the conventional PT test.</li>

Iron studies are best performed when the patient is fasting in the morning and has abstained from medications that may influence iron balance.</p>    
    
<p> Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia.  In young children on a milk diet, iron deficiency is often secondary to dietary deficiency.  In adults, iron deficiency is usually the result of blood loss and is only occasionally secondary to dietary deficiency or malabsorption.</p>    
    
<p> Following major surgery the patient may have iron deficient erythropoiesis for months or years if adequate iron replacement has not been given.  High doses of supplemental iron may cause the serum iron to be elevated.  Serum iron may also be altered in acute and chronic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.</p>    
    
<p> Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is an indirect measure of transferrin, a protein that binds and transports iron.  TIBC quantifies transferrin by the amount of iron that it can bind.  TIBC and transferrin are elevated in iron deficiency, and with oral contraceptive use, and during pregnancy.  TIBC and transferrin may be decreased in malabsorption syndromes or in those affected with chronic diseases.  The percent saturation represents the ratio of iron to the TIBC.</p>    
    
<p> Assays for ferritin are also useful in assessing iron balance.  Low concentrations are associated with iron deficiency and are highly specific.  High concentrations are found in hemosiderosis (iron overload without associated tissue injury) and hemochromatosis (iron overload with associated tissue injury).  In these conditions the iron is elevated, the TIBC and transferrin are within the reference range or low, and the percent saturation is elevated.  Serum ferritin can be useful for both initiating and monitoring treatment for iron overload.</p>    
    
<p> Transferrin and ferritin belong to a group of serum proteins known as acute phase reactants, and are increased in response to stressful or inflammatory conditions and also can occur with infection and tissue injury due to surgery, trauma or necrosis.  Ferritin and iron/TIBC (or transferrin) are affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and in patients with these disorders, tests of iron status may be difficult to interpret.</p>","<strong><p>Indications</p>    </strong>
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>Ferritin, iron and either iron binding capacity or transferrin are useful in the differential diagnosis of iron deficiency, anemia, and for iron overload conditions.     
    
<ol type=""a"" start=""1"">    
<li>The following presentations are examples that may support the use of these studies for evaluating iron deficiency: certain abnormal blood count values (i.e., decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit when the MCV is low or normal, or increased red cell distribution width (RDW) and low or normal MCV); abnormal appetite (pica); acute or chronic gastrointestinal blood loss; hematuria; menorrhagia; malabsorption; status post-gastrectomy; status post-gastrojejunostomy; malnutrition; preoperative autologous blood collection(s); malignant, chronic inflammatory and infectious conditions associated with anemia which may present in a similar manner to iron deficiency anemia; following a significant surgical procedure where blood loss had occurred and had not been repaired with adequate iron replacement. </li>    
    
<li>The following presentations are examples that may support the use of these studies for evaluating iron overload: chronic hepatitis; diabetes;<br>    
hyperpigmentation of skin; arthropathy; cirrhosis; hypogonadism; hypopituitarism; impaired porphyrin metabolism; heart failure; multiple transfusions; sideroblastic anemia; thalassemia major; cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances.</li>    
</ol>    
</li>    
    
<li>Follow-up testing may be appropriate to monitor response to therapy, e.g., oral or parenteral iron, ascorbic acid, and erythropoietin.</li>    
    
<li>Iron studies may be appropriate in patients after treatment for other nutritional deficiency anemias, such as folate and vitamin B12, because iron deficiency may not be revealed until such a nutritional deficiency is treated.</li>    
    
<li>Serum ferritin may be appropriate for monitoring iron status in patients with chronic renal disease with or without dialysis.</li>    
    
<li>Serum iron may also be indicated for evaluation of toxic effects of iron and other metals (e.g., nickel, cadmium, aluminum, lead) whether due to accidental, intentional exposure or metabolic causes.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<strong><p>Limitations</p>    </strong>
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>Iron studies should be used to diagnose and manage iron deficiency or iron overload states. These tests are not to be used solely to assess acute phase reactants where disease management will be unchanged. For example, infections and malignancies are associated with elevations in acute phase reactants such as ferritin, and decreases in serum iron concentration, but iron studies would only be medically necessary if results of iron studies might alter the management of the primary diagnosis or might warrant direct treatment of an iron disorder or condition.</li>    
    
<li>If a normal serum ferritin level is documented, repeat testing would not ordinarily be medically necessary unless there is a change in the patient's condition, and ferritin assessment is needed for the ongoing management of the patient. For example, a patient presents with new onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and has a serum ferritin level performed for the suspicion of hemochromatosis. If the ferritin level is normal, the repeat ferritin for diabetes mellitus would not be medically necessary.</li>    
    
<li>When an End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patient is tested for ferritin, testing more frequently than every three months requires documentation of medical necessity (e.g., other than chronic renal failure or renal failure, unspecified).</li>    
    
<li>It is ordinarily not necessary to measure both transferrin and TIBC at the same time because TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin. When transferrin is ordered as part of the nutritional assessment for evaluating malnutrition, it is not necessary to order other iron studies unless iron deficiency or iron overload is suspected as well.</li>    
    
<li>It is not ordinarily necessary to measure both iron/TIBC (or transferrin) and ferritin in initial patient testing. If clinically indicated after evaluation of the initial iron studies, it may be appropriate to perform additional iron studies either on the initial specimen or on a subsequently obtained specimen. After a diagnosis of iron deficiency or iron overload is established, either iron/TIBC (or transferrin) or ferritin may be medically necessary for monitoring, but not both.</li>    
    
<li>It would not ordinarily be considered medically necessary to do a ferritin as a preoperative test except in the presence of anemia or recent autologous blood collections prior to the surgery.</li>

Elevated levels of urinary collagen crosslinks indicate elevated bone resorption. Elevated bone resorption contributes to age-related and postmenopausal loss of bone leading to osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture. The collagen crosslinks assay can be performed by immunoassay or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Collagen crosslink immunoassays measure the pyridinoline crosslinks and associated telopeptides in urine.</p>    
    
<p>Bone is constantly undergoing a metabolic process called turnover or remodeling.  This includes a degradation process, bone resorption, mediated by the action of osteoclasts, and a building process, bone formation, mediated by the action of osteoblasts.  Remodeling is required for the maintenance and overall health of bone and is tightly coupled;  that is, resorption and formation must be in balance.  In abnormal states of bone remodeling, when resorption exceeds formation, it results in a net loss of bone.  The measurement of specific, bone-derived resorption products provides analytical data about the rate of bone resorption.</p>    
    
<p>Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist.  The term primary osteoporosis is applied where the causal factor in the disease is menopause or aging.  The term secondary osteoporosis is applied where the causal factor is something other than menopause or aging, such as long-term administration of glucocorticosteroids, endocrine-related disorders (other than loss of estrogen due to menopause), and certain bone diseases such as cancer of the bone.</p>    
    
<p>With respect to quantifying bone resorption, collagen crosslink tests can provide adjunct diagnostic information in concert with bone mass measurements.  Bone mass measurements and biochemical markers may have complementary roles to play in assessing effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment.  Proper management of osteoporosis patients, who are on long-term therapeutic regimens, may include laboratory testing of biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as collagen crosslinks, that provide a profile of bone turnover responses within weeks of therapy.  Changes in collagen crosslinks are determined following commencement of antiresorptive therapy.  These can be measured over a shorter time interval, such as three months, when compared to bone mass density.  If bone resorption is not elevated, repeat testing is not medically necessary.</p>","<strong><p>Indications</p>    </strong> 
    
<p>Generally speaking, collagen crosslink testing is useful mostly in ""fast losers"" of bone. The age when these bone markers can help direct therapy is often pre-Medicare. By the time a fast loser of bone reaches age 65, she will most likely have been stabilized by appropriate therapy or have lost so much bone mass that further testing is useless. Coverage for bone marker assays may be established, however, for younger Medicare beneficiaries and for those men and women who might become fast losers because of some other therapy such as glucocorticoids. Safeguards should be incorporated to prevent excessive use of tests in patients for whom they have no clinical relevance.</p>    
    
<p>Collagen crosslinks testing is used to:</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>Identify individuals with elevated bone resorption, who have osteoporosis in whom response to treatment is being monitored;</li>    
    
<li>Predict response (as assessed by bone mass measurements) to FDA approved antiresorptive therapy in postmenopausal women; and</li>    
    
<li>Assess response to treatment of patients with osteoporosis, Paget's disease of the bone, or risk for osteoporosis where treatment may include FDA approved antiresorptive agents, anti-estrogens or selective estrogen receptor moderators.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<strong><p>Limitations</p>  </strong>  
    
<p>Because of significant specimen to specimen collagen crosslink physiologic variability (15-20%), current recommendations for appropriate utilization include: one or two base-line assays from specified urine collections on separate days; followed by a repeat assay about three months after starting anti-resorptive therapy; followed by a repeat assay in 12 months after the three-month assay; and thereafter not more than annually, unless there is a change in therapy in which circumstance an additional test may be indicated three months after the initiation of new therapy.</p>    
    
<p>Some collagen crosslink assays may not be appropriate for use in some disorders, according to FDA labeling restrictions.</p>

<p>    External counterpulsation (ECP), commonly referred to as enhanced external counterpulsation, is a noninvasive outpatient treatment for coronary artery disease refractory to medical and/or surgical therapy. Although ECP devices are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating a variety of cardiac conditions, including stable or unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, the use of this device to treat cardiac conditions other than stable angina pectoris is not covered, since only that use has developed sufficient evidence to demonstrate its medical effectiveness. Non-coverage of hydraulic versions of these types of devices remains in force.</p>","<p><strong>  B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>  
  
<p>  Effective for services performed on or after July 1, 1999, coverage is provided for the use of ECP for patients who have been diagnosed with disabling angina (Class III or Class IV, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification or equivalent classification) who, in the opinion of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon, are not readily amenable to surgical intervention, such as PTCA or cardiac bypass, because:</p>  
  
<ol>  
<li>Their condition is inoperable, or at high risk of operative complications or post-operative failure;</li>  
<li>Their coronary anatomy is not readily amenable to such procedures; or</li>  
<li>They have co-morbid states which create excessive risk.</li>  
</ol>  
  
<p>A full course of therapy usually consists of 35 one-hour treatments, which may be offered once or twice daily, usually 5 days per week. The patient is placed on a treatment table where their lower trunk and lower extremities are wrapped in a series of three compressive air cuffs which inflate and deflate in synchronization with the patient's cardiac cycle.</p>  
  
<p>During diastole the three sets of air cuffs are inflated sequentially (distal to proximal) compressing the vascular beds within the muscles of the calves, lower thighs and upper thighs. This action results in an increase in diastolic pressure, generation of retrograde arterial blood flow and an increase in venous return. The cuffs are deflated simultaneously just prior to systole, which produces a rapid drop in vascular impedance, a decrease in ventricular workload and an increase in cardiac output.</p>  
  
<p>The augmented diastolic pressure and retrograde aortic flow appear to improve myocardial perfusion, while systolic unloading appears to reduce cardiac workload and oxygen requirements. The increased venous return coupled with enhanced systolic flow appears to increase cardiac output. As a result of this treatment, most patients experience increased time until onset of ischemia, increased exercise tolerance, and a reduction in the number and severity of anginal episodes. Evidence was presented that this effect lasted well beyond the immediate post-treatment phase, with patients symptom-free for several months to two years. This procedure must be done under direct supervision of a physician.</p>  
  
<p><strong>  C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>  
  
<p>  All other cardiac conditions not otherwise specified as nationally covered for the use of ECP remain nationally non-covered.</p>

Blood glucose determination may be done using whole blood, serum or plasma.  It may be sampled by capillary puncture, as in the fingerstick method, or by vein puncture or arterial sampling.  The method for assay may be by color comparison of an indicator stick, by meter assay of whole blood or a filtrate of whole blood, using a device approved for home monitoring, or by using a laboratory assay system using serum or plasma.  The convenience of the meter or stick color method allows a patient to have access to blood glucose values in less than a minute or so and has become a standard of care for control of blood glucose, even in the inpatient setting.</p>","<strong><p>Indications</p>    </strong> 
     
<p>Blood glucose values are often necessary for the management of patients with diabetes mellitus, where hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are often present.  They are also critical in the determination of control of blood glucose levels in the patient with impaired fasting glucose (FPG 110-125 mg/dL), the patient with insulin resistance syndrome and/or carbohydrate intolerance (excessive rise in glucose following ingestion of glucose or glucose sources of food), in the patient with a hypoglycemia disorder such as nesidioblastosis or insulinoma, and in patients with a catabolic or malnutrition state.  In addition to those conditions already listed,  glucose testing may be medically necessary in patients with tuberculosis, unexplained chronic or recurrent infections, alcoholism, coronary artery disease (especially in women), or unexplained skin conditions (including pruritis, local skin infections, ulceration and gangrene without an established cause).</p>     
     
<p>Many medical conditions may be a consequence of a sustained elevated or depressed glucose level.  These include comas, seizures or epilepsy, confusion, abnormal hunger, abnormal weight loss or gain, and loss of sensation.  Evaluation of glucose may also be indicated in patients on medications known to affect carbohydrate metabolism.</p>     
     
<p>Effective January 1, 2005, the Medicare law expanded coverage to diabetic screening services. Some forms of blood glucose testing covered under this national coverage determination may be covered for screening purposes subject to specified frequencies. See 42 CFR 410.18 and section 90, chapter 18, of the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS018912.html?DLPage=1&DLSort=0&DLSortDir=ascending"">Claims Processing Manual</a>, for a full description of this screening benefit.</p>     
     
<strong><p>Limitations</p>  </strong>
     
<p>Frequent home blood glucose testing by diabetic patients should be encouraged.  In stable, non-hospitalized patients who are unable or unwilling to do home monitoring, it may be reasonable and necessary to measure quantitative blood glucose up to four times annually.</p>     
     
<p>Depending upon the age of the patient, type of diabetes, degree of control, complications of diabetes, and other co-morbid conditions, more frequent testing than four times annually may be reasonable and necessary.</p>     
     
<p>In some patients presenting with nonspecific signs, symptoms, or diseases not normally associated with disturbances in glucose metabolism, a single blood glucose test may be medically necessary.  Repeat testing may not be indicated unless abnormal results are found or unless there is a change in clinical condition.  If repeat testing is performed, a specific diagnosis code (e.g., diabetes) should be reported to support medical necessity.  However, repeat testing may be indicated where results are normal in patients with conditions where there is a confirmed continuing risk of glucose metabolism abnormality (e.g., monitoring glucocorticoid therapy).</p>

Glycated hemoglobin/protein levels are used to assess long-term glucose control in diabetes. Alternative names for these tests include glycated or glycosylated hemoglobin or Hgb, hemoglobin glycated or glycosylated protein, and fructosamine.</p>    
    
<p>Glycated hemoglobin (equivalent to hemoglobin A1) refers to total glycosylated hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, usually determined by affinity or ion-exchange chromatographic methodology. Hemoglobin A1c refers to the major component of hemoglobin A1, usually determined by ion-exchange affinity chromatography, immunoassay or agar gel electrophoresis. Fructosamine or glycated protein refers to glycosylated protein present in a serum or plasma sample. Glycated protein refers to measurement of the component of the specific protein that is glycated usually by colorimetric method or affinity chromatography.</p>    
    
<p>Glycated hemoglobin in whole blood assesses glycemic control over a period of 4-8 weeks and appears to be the more appropriate test for monitoring a patient who is capable of maintaining long-term, stable control. Measurement may be medically necessary every 3 months to determine whether a patient's metabolic control has been on average within the target range. More frequent assessments, every 1-2 months, may be appropriate in the patient whose diabetes regimen has been altered to improve control or in whom evidence is present that intercurrent events may have altered a previously satisfactory level of control (for example, post-major surgery or as a result of glucocorticoid therapy). Glycated protein in serum/plasma assesses glycemic control over a period of 1-2 weeks. It may be reasonable and necessary to monitor glycated protein monthly in pregnant diabetic women. Glycated hemoglobin/protein test results may be low, indicating significant, persistent hypoglycemia, in nesidioblastosis or insulinoma, conditions which are accompanied by inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. A below normal test value is helpful in establishing the patient's hypoglycemic state in those conditions.</p>","<strong><p>Indications</p>    </strong> 
    
<p>Glycated hemoglobin/protein testing is widely accepted as medically necessary for the management and control of diabetes. It is also valuable to assess hyperglycemia, a history of hyperglycemia or dangerous hypoglycemia. Glycated protein testing may be used in place of glycated hemoglobin in the management of diabetic patients, and is particularly useful in patients who have abnormalities of erythrocytes such as hemolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathies.</p>    
    
<strong><p>Limitations</p>  </strong>  
    
<p>It is not considered reasonable and necessary to perform glycated hemoglobin tests more often than every three months on a controlled diabetic patient to determine whether the patient's metabolic control has been on average within the target range. It is not considered reasonable and necessary for these tests to be performed more frequently than once a month for diabetic pregnant women. Testing for uncontrolled type one or two diabetes mellitus may require testing more than four times a year. The above Description Section provides the clinical basis for those situations in which testing more frequently than four times per annum is indicated, and medical necessity documentation must support such testing in excess of the above guidelines.</p>    
    
<p>Many methods for the analysis of glycated hemoglobin show significant interference from elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin or by variant hemoglobin molecules. When the glycated hemoglobin assay is initially performed in these patients, the laboratory may inform the ordering physician of a possible analytical interference. Alternative testing, including glycated protein, for example, fructosamine, may be indicated for the monitoring of the degree of glycemic control in this situation. It is therefore conceivable that a patient will have both a glycated hemoglobin and glycated protein ordered on the same day. This should be limited to the initial assay of glycated hemoglobin, with subsequent exclusive use of glycated protein. These tests are not considered to be medically necessary for the diagnosis of diabetes.</p>

These abnormalities may be either primary or secondary and often but not always accompany clinically defined signs and symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction.</p>    
    
<p>Laboratory evaluation of thyroid function has become more scientifically defined. Tests can be done with increased specificity, thereby reducing the number of tests needed to diagnose and follow treatment of most thyroid disease. Measurements of serum sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complemented by determination of thyroid hormone levels [free thyroxine (fT-4) or total thyroxine (T4) with Triiodothyronine (T3) uptake] are used for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid disorders. </p>


<p>Additional tests may be necessary to evaluate certain complex diagnostic problems or on hospitalized patients, where many circumstances can skew tests results. When a test for total thyroxine (total T4 or T4 radioimmunoassay) or T3 uptake is performed, calculation of the free thyroxine index (FTI) is useful to correct for abnormal results for either total T4 or T3 uptake due to protein binding effects.    </p>","<p><strong>Indications</strong></p>    
    
<p>Thyroid function tests are used to define hyper function, euthyroidism, or hypofunction of thyroid disease. Thyroid testing may be reasonable and necessary to:</p>    
    
<ul>                                                        
<li>Distinguish between primary and secondary hypothyroidism;</li>    
    
<li>Confirm or rule out primary hypothyroidism;</li>    
    
<li>Monitor thyroid hormone levels (for example, patients with goiter, thyroid nodules, or thyroid cancer);</li>    
    
<li>Monitor drug therapy in patients with primary hypothyroidism;</li>    
    
<li>Confirm or rule out primary hyperthyroidism; and</li>    
    
<li>Monitor therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism.</li>    
</ul>    
    
<p>Thyroid function testing may be medically necessary in patients with disease or neoplasm of the thyroid and other endocrine glands. Thyroid function testing may also be medically necessary in patients with metabolic disorders; malnutrition; hyperlipidemia; certain types of anemia; psychosis and non-psychotic personality disorders; unexplained depression; ophthalmologic disorders; various cardiac arrhythmias; disorders of menstruation; skin conditions; myalgias; and a wide array of signs and symptoms, including alterations in consciousness; malaise; hypothermia; symptoms of the nervous and musculoskeletal system; skin and integumentary system; nutrition and metabolism; cardiovascular; and gastrointestinal system.</p>    
    
<p>It may be medically necessary to do follow-up thyroid testing in patients with a personal history of malignant neoplasm of the endocrine system and in patients on long-term thyroid drug therapy.</p>    
    
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>    
    
<p>Testing may be covered up to two times a year in clinically stable patients; more frequent testing may be reasonable and necessary for patients whose thyroid therapy has been altered or in whom symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism are noted.</p>

102,2,True,2,"190.23","Lipid Testing",2005-01-01 00:00:00,2005-03-11 00:00:00,,"<p>Lipoproteins are a class of heterogeneous particles of varying sizes and densities containing lipid and protein. These lipoproteins include cholesterol esters and free cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and A, C, and E apoproteins. Total cholesterol comprises all the cholesterol found in various lipoproteins.</p>    
    
<p>Factors that affect blood cholesterol levels include age, sex, body weight, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, exercise, genetic factors, family history, medications, menopausal status, the use of hormone replacement therapy, and chronic disorders such as hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, pancreatic disease (including diabetes), and kidney disease.</p>    
    
<p>In many individuals, an elevated blood cholesterol level constitutes an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Blood levels of total cholesterol and various fractions of cholesterol, especially low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), are useful in assessing and monitoring treatment for that risk in patients with cardiovascular and related diseases. Blood levels of the above cholesterol components including triglyceride have been separated into desirable, borderline and high risk categories by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in their report in 1993. These categories form a useful basis for evaluation and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. Therapy to reduce these risk parameters includes diet, exercise and medication, and fat weight loss, which is particularly powerful when combined with diet and exercise.</p>","<strong><p>Indications</p>    </strong> 
    
<p>The medical community recognizes lipid testing as appropriate for evaluating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conditions in which lipid testing may be indicated include:</p>    
    
<ul>    
<li>Assessment of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</li>    
<li>Evaluation of primary dyslipidemia.</li>    
<li>Any form of atherosclerotic disease, or any disease leading to the formation of atherosclerotic disease.</li>    
<li>Diagnostic evaluation of diseases associated with altered lipid metabolism, such as: nephrotic syndrome, pancreatitis, hepatic disease, and hypo and hyperthyroidism.</li> <li>Secondary dyslipidemia, including diabetes mellitus, disorders of gastrointestinal absorption, chronic renal failure.</li>    
<li>Signs or symptoms of dyslipidemias, such as skin lesions.</li>    
<li>As follow-up to the initial screen for coronary heart disease (total cholesterol + HDL cholesterol) when total cholesterol is determined to be high (&gt;240 mg/dL), or borderline-high (200-240 mg/dL) plus two or more coronary heart disease risk factors, or an HDL cholesterol, &lt;35 mg/dl.</li>    
</ul>    
    
<p>To monitor the progress of patients on anti-lipid dietary management and pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of elevated blood lipid disorders, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol may be used. Triglycerides may be obtained if this lipid fraction is also elevated or if the patient is put on drugs (for example, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and tamoxifen) which may raise the triglyceride level.</p>    
    
<p>When monitoring long term anti-lipid dietary or pharmacologic therapy and when following patients with borderline high total or LDL cholesterol levels, it may be reasonable to perform the lipid panel annually. A lipid panel at a yearly interval will usually be adequate while measurement of the serum total cholesterol or a measured LDL should suffice for interim visits if the patient does not have hypertriglyceridemia.</p>    
    
<p>Any one component of the panel or a measured LDL may be reasonable and necessary up to six times the first year for monitoring dietary or pharmacologic therapy. More frequent total cholesterol HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride testing may be indicated for marked elevations or for changes to anti-lipid therapy due to inadequate initial patient response to dietary or pharmacologic therapy. The LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol may be measured three times yearly after treatment goals have been achieved.</p>    
    
<p>Electrophoretic or other quantitation of lipoproteins may be indicated if the patient has a primary disorder of lipoid metabolism.</p>    
    
<p>Effective January 1, 2005, the Medicare law expanded coverage to cardiovascular screening services. Several of the procedures included in this NCD may be covered for screening purposes subject to specified frequencies. See 42 CFR 410.17 and section 100, chapter 18, of the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS018912.html?DLPage=1&DLSort=0&DLSortDir=ascending"">Claims Processing Manual</a>, for a full description of this benefit.</p>    
    
<strong><p>Limitations</p>  </strong>  
    
<p>Lipid panel and hepatic panel testing may be used for patients with severe psoriasis which has not responded to conventional therapy and for which the retinoid etretinate has been prescribed and who have developed hyperlipidemia or hepatic toxicity. Specific examples include erythrodermia and generalized pustular type and psoriasis associated with arthritis.</p>    
    
<p>Routine screening and prophylactic testing for lipid disorder are not covered by Medicare. While lipid screening may be medically appropriate, Medicare by statute does not pay for it. Lipid testing in asymptomatic individuals is considered to be screening regardless of the presence of other risk factors such as family history, tobacco use, etc.</p>    
    
<p>Once a diagnosis is established, one or several specific tests are usually adequate for monitoring the course of the disease. Less specific diagnoses (for example, other chest pain) alone do not support medical necessity of these tests.</p>    
    
<p>When monitoring long term anti-lipid dietary or pharmacologic therapy and when following patients with borderline high total or LDL cholesterol levels, it is reasonable to perform the lipid panel annually. A lipid panel at a yearly interval will usually be adequate while measurement of the serum total cholesterol or a measured LDL should suffice for interim visits if the patient does not have hypertriglyceridemia.</p>    
    
<p>Any one component of the panel or a measured LDL may be medically necessary up to six times the first year for monitoring dietary or pharmacologic therapy. More frequent total cholesterol HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride testing may be indicated for marked elevations or for changes to anti-lipid therapy due to inadequate initial patient response to dietary or pharmacologic therapy. The LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol may be measured three times yearly after treatment goals have been achieved.</p>    
    
<p>If no dietary or pharmacological therapy is advised, monitoring is not necessary.</p>    
    
<p>When evaluating non-specific chronic abnormalities of the liver (for example, elevations of transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, abnormal imaging studies, etc.), a lipid panel would generally not be indicated more than twice per year.</p>

<p>Digoxin levels may be performed to monitor drug levels of individuals receiving digoxin therapy because the margin of safety between side effects and toxicity is narrow or because the blood level may not be high enough to achieve the desired clinical effect.</p>    
    
<p>Clinical indications may include individuals on digoxin:</p>    
    
<ul>    
<li>With symptoms, signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) suggestive of digoxin toxicity.</li>    
<li>Taking medications that influence absorption, bioavailability, distribution, and/or elimination of digoxin.</li>    
<li>With impaired renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or thyroid function.</li>    
<li>With pH and/or electrolyte abnormalities.</li>    
<li>With unstable cardiovascular status, including myocarditis.</li>    
<li>Requiring monitoring of patient compliance.</li>    
</ul>    
    
<p>Clinical indications may include individuals:</p>    
    
<ul>    
<li>Suspected of accidental or intended overdose.</li>    
<li>Who have an acceptable cardiac diagnosis (as listed) and for whom an accurate history of use of digoxin is unobtainable.</li>    
</ul>    
    
<p>The value of obtaining regular serum digoxin levels is uncertain, but it may be reasonable to check levels once yearly after a steady state is achieved. In addition, it may be reasonable to check the level if:</p>    
    
<ul>    
<li>Heart failure status worsens.</li>    
<li>Renal function deteriorates.</li>    
<li>Additional medications are added that could affect the digoxin level.</li>    
<li>Signs or symptoms of toxicity develop.</li>    
</ul>    
    
<p>Steady state will be reached in approximately 1 week in patients with normal renal function, although 2-3 weeks may be needed in patients with renal impairment. After changes in dosages or the addition of a medication that could affect the digoxin level, it is reasonable to check the digoxin level one week after the change or addition. Based on the clinical situation, in cases of digoxin toxicity, testing may need to be done more than once a week.</p>    
    
<p>Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and for reduction of the ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Digoxin may also be indicated for the treatment of other supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of heart failure.</p>    
    
<p>Limitations</p>    
    
<p>This test is not appropriate for patients on digitoxin or treated with digoxin FAB (fragment antigen binding) antibody.</p>

Intracardiac electrode catheters, intracardiac and extracardiac recordings and a stimulator device are required. From two to six multipolar electrode catheters are inserted percutaneously, usually through the femoral veins, and advanced to the heart under fluoroscopic control. Other venous or arterial routes may be employed as well. An intracardiac His bundle cardiogram is usually obtained during EES as are conventional electrocardiograms.

In the last few years, several new approaches in the surgical management of upper urinary tract kidney stones have been developed, among them invasive and non-invasive lithotripsy techniques.</p>","<p> In addition to the traditional surgical/endoscopic techniques for the treatment of kidney stones, the following lithotripsy techniques are also covered for services rendered on or after March l5, l985.</p>

<strong><p>A. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy</p></strong>

<p> Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive method of treating kidney stones using a device called a lithotriptor. The lithotriptor uses shock waves generated outside of the body to break up upper urinary tract stones. It focuses the shock waves specifically on stones under X-ray visualization, pulverizing them by repeated shocks. ESWL is covered under Medicare for use in the treatment of upper urinary tract kidney stones.</p>

<strong><p>B. Percutaneous Lithotripsy</p></strong>

<p> Percutaneous lithotripsy (or nephrolithotomy) is an invasive method of treating kidney stones by using ultrasound, electrohydraulic or mechanical lithotripsy. A probe is inserted through an incision in the skin directly over the kidney and applied to the stone. A form of lithotripsy is then used to fragment the stone.

<p>Effective for services performed on or after February 15, 2018 CMS has determined that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that the use of ICDs, (also referred to as defibrillators) is reasonable and necessary:</p>

<ol>
<li>Patients with a personal history of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) or cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Patients must have demonstrated:
<ul><li> An episode of sustained VT, either spontaneous or induced by an electrophysiology (EP) study, not associated with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and not due to a transient or reversible cause; or
<li> An episode of cardiac arrest due to VF, not due to a transient or reversible cause.</ul></li>
	
<li>Patients with a prior MI and a measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le; 0.30. Patients must not have:
<ul><li> New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification IV heart failure; or,
<li> Had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with angioplasty and/or stenting, within the past 3 months; or,
<li> Had an MI within the past 40 days; or,
<li> Clinical symptoms and findings that would make them a candidate for coronary revascularization.</ul>
	
<p>For these patients identified in B2, a formal shared decision making encounter must occur between the patient and a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act))or qualified non-physician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in §1861(aa)(5) of the Act) using an evidence-based decision tool on ICDs prior to initial ICD implantation. The shared decision making encounter may occur at a separate visit. </p></li>
	
<li>Patients who have severe, ischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy but no personal history of sustained VT or cardiac arrest due to VF, and have NYHA Class II or III heart failure, LVEF &le; 35%. Additionally, patients must not have:

<ul><li> Had a CABG, or PCI with angioplasty and/or stenting, within the past 3 months; or,
<li> Had an MI within the past 40 days; or,
<li> Clinical symptoms and findings that would make them a candidate for coronary revascularization.</ul>
	
<p>For these patients identified in B3, a formal shared decision making encounter must occur between the patient and a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) or qualified nonphysician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in §1861(aa)(5) of the Act) using an evidence-based decision tool on ICDs prior to initial ICD implantation. The shared decision making encounter may occur at a separate visit.</p></li>
		
<li>Patients who have severe, non-ischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy but no personal history of sustained VT <font color=""FF0000""><em>or cardiac arrest due to VF, and have</em></font> NYHA Class II or III heart failure, LVEF &le; 35%, been on optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months. Additionally, patients must not have:

<ul><li> Had a CABG or PCI with angioplasty and/or stenting, within the past 3 months; or,
<li> Had an MI within the past 40 days; or,
<li> Clinical symptoms and findings that would make them a candidate for coronary revascularization.</ul>
	
<p>For these patients identified in B4, a formal shared decision making encounter must occur between the patient and a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) or qualified nonphysician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in §1861(aa)(5) of the Act) using an evidence-based decision tool on ICDs prior to initial ICD implantation. The shared decision making encounter may occur at a separate visit.</p></li>
	
<li>Patients with documented, familial or genetic disorders with a high risk of life-threatening tachyarrhythmias (sustained VT or VF), to include, but not limited to, long QT syndrome or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
	
<p>For these patients identified in B5, a formal shared decision making encounter must occur between the patient and a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) or qualified nonphysician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in §1861(aa)(5) of the Act) using an evidence-based decision tool on ICDs prior to initial ICD implantation. The shared decision making encounter may occur at a separate visit.</p></li>
	
<li>Patients with an existing ICD may receive an ICD replacement if it is required due to the end of battery life, elective replacement indicator (ERI), or device/lead malfunction.</li></ol>

<p>For each of the 6 covered indications above, the following additional criteria must also be met:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patients must be clinically stable (e.g., not in shock, from any etiology);</li>
<li>LVEF must be measured by echocardiography, radionuclide (nuclear medicine) imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or catheter angiography;</li>
<li>Patients must not have:
<ul><li> Significant, irreversible brain damage; or,
<li> Any disease, other than cardiac disease (e.g., cancer, renal failure, liver failure) associated
with a likelihood of survival less than 1 year; or,
<li> Supraventricular tachycardia such as atrial fibrillation with a poorly controlled ventricular
	rate.</ul></li></ol>
	
<p>Exceptions to waiting periods for patients that have had a CABG, or PCI with angioplasty and/or stenting, within the past 3 months, or had an MI within the past 40 days:</p>
<p>
<div style=""margin-left: 1cm;"">Cardiac Pacemakers: Patients who meet all CMS coverage requirements for cardiac pacemakers, and who meet the criteria in this national coverage determination for an ICD, may receive the combined devices in one procedure, at the time the pacemaker is clinically indicated; <br>Replacement of ICDs: Patients with an existing ICD may receive an ICD replacement if it is required due to the end of battery life, ERI, or device/lead malfunction. </div></p>

<p>Cardiac transplantation is covered under Medicare when performed in a facility which is approved by Medicare as meeting institutional coverage criteria. (See CMS Ruling 87-1.)</p>  
  
<p><strong>B. Exceptions</strong></p>  
  
<p>In certain limited cases, exceptions to the criteria may be warranted if there is justification and if the facility ensures our objectives of safety and efficacy. Under no circumstances will exceptions be made for facilities whose transplant programs have been in existence for less than 2 years, and applications from consortia will not be approved.</p>  
  
<p>Although consortium arrangements will not be approved for payment of Medicare heart transplants, consideration will be given to applications from heart transplant facilities that consist of more than one hospital where all of the following conditions exist:</p>  
  
<ul>  
<li>The hospitals are under the common control or have a formal affiliation arrangement with each other under the auspices of an organization such as a university or a legally constituted medical research institute; and</li>  
  
<li>The hospitals share resources by routinely using the same personnel or services in their transplant programs. The sharing of resources must be supported by the submission of operative notes or other information that documents the routine use of the same personnel and services in all of the individual hospitals. At a minimum, shared resources means:</li>  
  
<li>The individual members of the transplant team, consisting of the cardiac transplant surgeons, cardiologists and pathologists, must practice in all the hospitals and it can be documented that they otherwise function as members of the transplant team; and</li>  
  
<li>The same organ procurement organization, immunology, and tissue-typing services must be used by all the hospitals;</li>  
  
<li>The hospitals submit, in the manner required (Kaplan-Meier method) their individual and pooled experience and survival data; and</li>  
  
<li>The hospitals otherwise meet the remaining Medicare criteria for heart transplant facilities; that is, the criteria regarding patient selection, patient management, program commitment, etc.</li>  
</ul>  
  
<p><strong>C. Pediatric Hospitals</strong></p>  
  
<p>Cardiac transplantation is covered for Medicare beneficiaries when performed in a pediatric hospital that performs pediatric heart transplants if the hospital submits an application which CMS approves as documenting that:</p>  
  
<ul>  
<li>The hospital&#8217;s pediatric heart transplant program is operated jointly by the hospital and another facility that has been found by CMS to meet the institutional coverage criteria in CMS Ruling 87-1;</li>  
  
<li>The unified program shares the same transplant surgeons and quality assurance program (including oversight committee, patient protocol, and patient selection criteria); and</li>  
  
<li>The hospital is able to provide the specialized facilities, services, and personnel that are required by pediatric heart transplant patients.</li>  
</ul>  
  
<p><strong>D. Follow-Up Care</strong></p>  
  
<p>Follow-up care required as a result of a covered heart transplant is covered, provided such services are otherwise reasonable and necessary. Follow-up care is also covered for patients who have been discharged from a hospital after receiving a noncovered heart transplant. Coverage for follow-up care would be for items and services that are reasonable and necessary, as determined by Medicare guidelines.

<p>Extracorporeal photopheresis is a medical procedure in which a patient’s white blood cells are exposed first to a drug called 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and then to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The procedure starts with the removal of the patient’s blood, which is centrifuged to isolate the white blood cells. The drug is typically administered directly to the white blood cells after they have been removed from the patient (referred to as ex vivo administration) but the drug can alternatively be administered directly to the patient before the white blood cells are withdrawn. After UVA light exposure, the treated white blood cells are then re-infused into the patient.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>    

<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that extracorporeal photopheresis is reasonable and necessary under §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) under the following circumstances:</p>    
    
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Effective April 8, 1988, Medicare provides coverage for:</p>
	
<p>Palliative treatment of skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that has not responded to other therapy.</p>    
    
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Effective December 19, 2006, Medicare also provides coverage for:</p>    
	
<p>Patients with acute cardiac allograft rejection whose disease is refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug treatment; and,</p> 
	
<p>Patients with chronic graft versus host disease whose disease is refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug treatment.</p>
   
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Effective April 30, 2012, Medicare also provides coverage for:</p>    
    
<p>Extracorporeal photopheresis for the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) following lung allograft transplantation only when extracorporeal photopheresis is provided under a clinical research study that meets the following conditions:</p>    
    
<p>The clinical research study meets the requirements specified below to assess the effect of extracorporeal photopheresis for the treatment of BOS following lung allograft transplantation. The clinical study must address one or more aspects of the following question:</p>    
    
<p>Prospectively, do Medicare beneficiaries who have received lung allografts, developed BOS refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy, and received extracorporeal photopheresis , experience improved patient-centered health outcomes as indicated by:</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"" type=""a"">    
    
<li>improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1);</li>    
<li>improved survival after transplant; and/or,</li>    
<li>improved quality of life?</li></ol>    
    
<p>The required clinical study must adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"" type=""a"">    
<li>The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether extracorporeal photopheresis potentially improves the participants’ health outcomes.</li>    
<li>The research study is well supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.</li>    
<li>The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies.</li>    
<li>The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study.</li>    
<li>The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of successfully executing the proposed study.</li>    
<li>The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it must also be in compliance with 21 CFR parts 50 and 56.</li>    
<li>All aspects of the research study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see http://www.icmje.org).</li>    
<li>The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare requirements for coverage with evidence development.</li>    
<li>The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR § 312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.</li>    
<li>The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject.</li>    
<li>The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org).</li>    
<li>The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary.</li>    
<li>The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility.</li></ol>    
    
<p>Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet the above-listed standards and address the above-listed research questions.</p>    
    
<p>Any clinical study under which there is coverage of extracorporeal photopheresis for this indication pursuant to this national coverage determination (NCD) must be approved by April 30, 2014. If there are no approved clinical studies on this date, this NCD will expire and coverage of extracorporeal photopheresis for BOS will revert to the coverage policy in effect prior to the issuance of the final decision memorandum for this NCD.</p>

Typically, patients are taught TM techniques over the course of several sessions by persons trained in TM. The patient then uses the TM technique on his or her own to induce the relaxed state. Proponents of TM have urged that Medicare cover the training of patients to practice TM when it is medically prescribed as treatment for mild hypertension, as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of essential hypertension, or as the sole or adjunctive treatment of anxiety and other psychological stress-related disorders.</p>
","<p>   After review of this issue, CMS has concluded that the evidence concerning the medical efficacy of TM is incomplete at best and does not demonstrate effectiveness and that a professional level of skill is not required for the training of patients to engage in TM.</p>

It is effective as a biochemical marker for monitoring the response of certain malignancies to therapy.</p>","<strong><p>Indications</p>    </strong>   
     
<p>       CEA may be medically necessary for follow-up of patients with colorectal carcinoma. It would however only be medically necessary at treatment decision-making points. In some clinical situations (e.g. adenocarcinoma of the lung, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and some gastrointestinal carcinomas) when a more specific marker is not expressed by the tumor, CEA may be a medically necessary alternative marker for monitoring. Preoperative CEA may also be helpful in determining the post-operative adequacy of surgical resection and subsequent medical management. In general, a single tumor marker will suffice in following patients with colorectal carcinoma or other malignancies that express such tumor markers.</p>     
     
<p>       In following patients who have had treatment for colorectal carcinoma, ASCO guideline suggests that if resection of liver metastasis would be indicated, it is recommended that post-operative CEA testing be performed every two to three months in patients with initial stage II or stage III disease for at least two years after diagnosis.</p>     
     
<p>       For patients with metastatic solid tumors which express CEA, CEA may be measured at the start of the treatment and with subsequent treatment cycles to assess the tumor's response to therapy.</p>     
     
<strong><p>Limitations</p>  </strong>
     
<p>       Serum CEA determinations are generally not indicated more frequently than once per chemotherapy treatment cycle for patients with metastatic solid tumors which express CEA or every two months post-surgical treatment for patients who have had colorectal carcinoma. However, it may be proper to order the test more frequently in certain situations, for example, when there has been a significant change from prior CEA level or a significant change in patient status which could reflect disease progression or recurrence.</p>     
     
<p>       Testing with a diagnosis of an in situ carcinoma is not reasonably done more frequently than once, unless the result is abnormal, in which case the test may be repeated once.</p>

<ul>   
<li>Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema (as defined by radiologist assessment of upper lobe predominance on CT scan), or</li> 
<li>Severe non-upper lobe emphysema with low exercise capacity.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Patients with low exercise capacity are those whose maximal exercise capacity is at or below 25 watts for women and 40 watts (w) for men after completion of the preoperative therapeutic program in preparation for LVRS.&#160; Exercise capacity is measured by incremental, maximal, symptom-limited exercise with a cycle ergometer utilizing 5 or 10 watt/minute ramp on 30% oxygen after 3 minutes of unloaded pedaling.</p> 
 
<p><strong>3. Effective for services performed on or after November 17, 2005, CMS determines that LVRS is reasonable and necessary when performed at facilities that are:</strong></p> 
 
<p>(1) certified by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission) under the LVRS Disease Specific Care Certification Program (program standards and requirements as printed in the Joint Commission&#8217;s October 25, 2004, Disease Specific Care Certification Program packet); or (2) approved as Medicare lung or heart-lung transplantation hospitals.</p> 
 
<p>In addition, LVRS performed between January 1, 2004, and May 17, 2007, is reasonable and necessary when performed at facilities that: (1) were approved by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to participate in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT); or (2) are approved as Medicare lung or heart-lung transplantation hospitals.</p> 
 
<p>A list of approved facilities and their approval dates will be listed and maintained on the CMS Web site at <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/Lung-Volume-Reduction-Surgery-LVRS.html#TopOfPage#TopOfPage"">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/04_lvrs.asp#TopOfPage</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The surgery must be preceded and followed by a program of diagnostic and therapeutic services consistent with those provided in the NETT and designed to maximize the patient's potential to successfully undergo and recover from surgery. The program must include a 6- to 10-week series of at least 16, and no more than 20, preoperative sessions, each lasting a minimum of 2 hours.&#160; It must also include at least 6, and no more than 10, postoperative sessions, each lasting a minimum of 2 hours, within 8 to 9 weeks of the LVRS.&#160; This program must be consistent with the care plan developed by the treating physician following performance of a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical, psychosocial and nutritional needs, be consistent with the preoperative and postoperative services provided in the NETT, and arranged, monitored, and performed under the coordination of the facility where the surgery takes place.</p> 
 
<p><strong>C. Nationally Non-covered Indications</strong></p> 
 
<p><strong>1. LVRS is not covered in any of the following clinical circumstances:</strong></p> 
 
<ol type=""a"">   
<li>Patient characteristics carry a high risk for perioperative morbidity and/or mortality;</li> 
 
<li>The disease is unsuitable for LVRS;</li> 
 
<li>Medical conditions or other circumstances make it likely that the patient will be unable to complete the preoperative and postoperative pulmonary diagnostic and therapeutic program required for surgery;</li> 
 
<li>The patient presents with FEV1 &le; 20% of predicted value, and either homogeneous distribution of emphysema on CT scan, or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of &le; 20% of predicted value (high-risk group identified October 2001 by the NETT); or</li> 
 
<li>The patient satisfies the criteria outlined above in section B(1), and has severe, non-upper lobe emphysema with high exercise capacity. High exercise capacity is defined as a maximal workload at the completion of the preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic program that is above 25 w for women and 40 w for men (under the measurement conditions for cycle ergometry specified above).</li>

120,1,True,1,"20.6","Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR)",1999-07-01 00:00:00,,,"<p> Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR) is a surgical technique which uses a laser to bore holes through the myocardium of the heart in an attempt to restore perfusion to areas of the heart not being reached by diseased or clogged arteries. This technique is used as a late or last resort for relief of symptoms of severe angina in patients with ischemic heart disease not amenable to direct coronary revascularization interventions, such as angioplasty, stenting or open coronary bypass.</p>

<p>     The precise workings of this technique are not certain. The original theory upon which the technique was based, that the open channels would result in increased perfusion of the myocardium, does not appear to be the major or only action at work. Several theories have been proposed, including partial denervation of the myocardium, or the triggering of the cascade of biological reactions which encourage increased development of blood vessels.</p>

<p>     However, research at several facilities indicates that, despite this uncertainty, the technique does offer relief of angina symptoms for a period of time in patients for whom no other medical treatment offering relief is available. Studies indicate that both reduction in pain and reduction in hospitalizations are significant for most patients treated. Consequently, we have concluded that, for patients with severe angina (Class III or IV, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, or similar classification system) for whom all other medical therapies have been tried or evaluated and found insufficient, such therapy offers sufficient evidence of its medical effectiveness to treat the symptomatology. It is important to note that this technique does not provide for increased life expectancy, nor is it proven to affect the underlying cause of the angina. However, it appears effective in treating the symptoms of angina, and reducing hospitalizations and allowing patients to resume some of their normal activities of daily living.</p>","<p>  CMS&#160;therefore covers TMR as a late or last resort for patients with severe (Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification Classes III or IV) angina (stable or unstable), which has been found refractory to standard medical therapy, including drug therapy at the maximum tolerated or maximum safe dosages. In addition, the angina symptoms must be caused by areas of the heart not amenable to surgical therapies such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stenting, coronary atherectomy or coronary bypass. </p>

<p>Coverage is further limited to those uses of the laser used in performing the procedure which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the purpose for which they are being used.</p>

<p>  Patients would have to meet the following additional selection guidelines:</p>

<li>  Have areas of viable ischemic myocardium (as demonstrated by diagnostic study) which are not capable of being revascularized by direct coronary intervention; and</li>

<li>  Have been stabilized, or have had maximal efforts to stabilize acute conditions such as severe ventricular arrhythmias, decompensated congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction.</li>
</ul>

<p>  Coverage is limited to physicians who have been properly trained in the procedure. Providers of this service must also document that all ancillary personnel, including physicians, nurses, operating room personnel and technicians, are trained in the procedure and the proper use of the equipment involved. Coverage is further limited to providers which have dedicated cardiac care units, including the diagnostic and support services necessary for care of patients undergoing this therapy.

When elevated, serum concentration of these markers may reflect tumor size and grade.</p>    
    
<p>    This policy specifically addresses tumor antigen CA 125.</p>","<strong><p>    Indications</p> </strong>  
    
<p>    CA 125 is a high molecular weight serum tumor marker elevated in 80% of patients who present with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. It is also elevated in carcinomas of the fallopian tube, endometrium, and endocervix. An elevated level may also be associated with the presence of a malignant mesothelioma <em>    or primary peritoneal carcinoma</em>.</p>    
    
<p>     A CA125 level may be obtained as part of the initial pre-operative work-up for women presenting with a suspicious pelvic mass to be used as a baseline for purposes of post-operative monitoring. Initial declines in CA 125 after initial surgery and/or chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma are also measured by obtaining three serum levels during the first month post treatment to determine the patient's CA 125 half-life, which has significant prognostic implications.</p>    
    
<p>         The CA 125 levels are again obtained at the completion of chemotherapy as an index of residual disease. Surveillance CA125 measurements are generally obtained every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter. CA 125 levels are also an important indicator of a patient's response to therapy in the presence of advanced or recurrent disease. In this setting, CA 125 levels may be obtained prior to each treatment cycle.</p>    
    
<strong><p>     Limitations</p>  </strong>  
    
<p>     These services are not covered for the evaluation of patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of malignancy. The service may be ordered at times necessary to assess either the presence of recurrent disease or the patient's response to treatment with subsequent treatment cycles.</p>    
    
<p>         The CA 125 is specifically not covered for aiding in the differential diagnosis of patients with a pelvic mass as the sensitivity and specificity of the test is not sufficient. In general, a single ""tumor marker"" will suffice in following a patient with one of these malignancies.</p>

ES for the treatment of wounds is the application of electrical current through electrodes placed directly on the skin in close proximity to the wound. Electromagnetic therapy uses a pulsed magnetic field to induce current. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was asked to reconsider its national non-coverage determination for electromagnetic therapy. After thorough review, CMS determined that the results from the use of electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds were similar to the results from the use of ES. Therefore, effective July 1, 2004, Medicare will cover electromagnetic therapy for the same settings and conditions for which ES is covered. This means Medicare will allow either one covered ES therapy or one covered electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds.</p>","<strong><p>A. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>    The use of ES and electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds are considered adjunctive therapies, and will only be covered for chronic Stage III or Stage IV pressure ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. Chronic ulcers are defined as ulcers that have not healed within 30 days of occurrence. ES or electromagnetic therapy will be covered only after appropriate standard wound therapy has been tried for at least 30 days and there are no measurable signs of improved healing. This 30-day period may begin while the wound is acute.</p>

<p>    Standard wound care includes: optimization of nutritional status, debridement by any means to remove devitalized tissue, maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with appropriate moist dressings, and necessary treatment to resolve any infection that may be present. Standard wound care based on the specific type of wound includes: frequent repositioning of a patient with pressure ulcers (usually every 2 hours), offloading of pressure and good glucose control for diabetic ulcers, establishment of adequate circulation for arterial ulcers, and the use of a compression system for patients with venous ulcers.</p>

<p>    Measurable signs of improved healing include: a decrease in wound size (either surface area or volume), decrease in amount of exudates, and decrease in amount of necrotic tissue. ES or electromagnetic therapy must be discontinued when the wound demonstrates 100% epitheliliazed wound bed.</p>

<p>    ES and electromagnetic therapy services can only be covered when performed by a physician, physical therapist, or incident to a physician service. Evaluation of the wound is an integral part of wound therapy. When a physician, physical therapist, or a clinician incident to a physician, performs ES or electromagnetic therapy, the practitioner must evaluate the wound and contact the treating physician if the wound worsens. If ES or electromagnetic therapy is being used, wounds must be evaluated at least monthly by the treating physician.</p>

<strong><p>B.  Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>    1. ES and electromagnetic therapy will not be covered as an initial treatment modality.</p>

<p>    2. Continued treatment with ES or electromagnetic therapy is not covered if measurable signs of healing have not been demonstrated within any 30-day period of treatment.</p>

<p>  A hospital stay and related ancillary services for the administration of L-Dopa are covered if medically required for this purpose. Whether a drug represents an allowable inpatient hospital cost during such stay depends on whether it meets the definition of a drug in &#167;1861(t) of the Act; i.e., on its inclusion in the compendia named in the Act or approval by the hospital's pharmacy and drug therapeutics (P&amp;DT) or equivalent committee. (Levodopa (L-Dopa) has been favorably evaluated for the treatment of Parkinsonism by A.M.A. Drug Evaluations, First Edition 1971, the replacement compendia for ""New Drugs."")</p>

<p>  Inpatient hospital services are frequently not required in many cases when L-Dopa therapy is initiated. Therefore, determine the medical need for inpatient hospital services on the basis of medical facts in the individual case. It is not necessary to hospitalize the typical, well-functioning, ambulatory Parkinsonian patient who has no concurrent disease at the start of L-Dopa treatment. It is reasonable to provide inpatient hospital services for Parkinsonian patients with concurrent diseases, particularly of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric systems. Although many patients require hospitalization for a period of under 2 weeks, a 4-week period of inpatient care is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>  Laboratory tests in connection with the administration of L-Dopa - The tests medically warranted in connection with the achievement of optimal dosage and the control of the side effects of L-Dopa include a complete blood count, liver function tests such as SGOT, SGPT, and/or alkaline phosphatase, BUN or creatinine and urinalysis, blood sugar, and electrocardiogram.</p>

<p>  Whether or not the patient is hospitalized, laboratory tests in certain cases are reasonable at weekly intervals although some physicians prefer to perform the tests much less frequently.</p>

<p>  Physical therapy furnished in connection with administration of L-Dopa - Where, following administration of the drug, the patient experiences a reduction of rigidity which permits the reestablishment of a restorative goal for him/her, physical therapy services required to enable him/her to achieve this goal are payable provided they require the skills of a qualified physical therapist and are furnished by or under the supervision of such a therapist. However, once the individual's restoration potential has been achieved, the services required to maintain him/her at this level do not generally require the skills of a qualified physical therapist. In such situations, the role of the therapist is to evaluate the patient's needs in consultation with his/her physician and design a program of exercise appropriate to the capacity and tolerance of the patient and treatment objectives of the physician, leaving to others the actual carrying out of the program. While the evaluative services rendered by a qualified physical therapist are payable as physical therapy, services furnished by others in connection with the carrying out of the maintenance program established by the therapist are not.</p>

<strong><p>B.  Part A Reimbursement for L-Dopa Therapy in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)</p></strong>

<p>  Initiation of L-Dopa therapy can be appropriately carried out in the SNF setting, applying the same guidelines used for initiation of L-Dopa therapy in the hospital, including the types of patients who should be covered for inpatient services, the role of physical therapy, and the use of laboratory tests. (See subsection A.)</p>

<p>  Where inpatient care is required and L-Dopa therapy is initiated in the SNF, limit the stay to a maximum of 4 weeks; but in many cases the need may be no longer than 1 or 2 weeks, depending upon the patient's condition. However, where L-Dopa therapy is begun in the hospital and the patient is transferred to an SNF for continuation of the therapy, a combined length of stay in hospital and SNF of no longer than 4 weeks is reasonable (i.e., 1 week hospital stay followed by 3 weeks SNF stay; or 2&#160;weeks hospital stay followed by 2 weeks SNF stay; etc.). Medical need must be demonstrated in cases where the combined length of stay in hospital and SNF is longer than 4&#160;weeks. The choice of hospital or SNF, and the decision regarding the relative length of time spent in each, should be left to the medical judgment of the treating physician.</p>

<strong><p>C.  L-Dopa Coverage Under Part B</p></strong>

<p>  Part B reimbursement may not be made for the drug L-Dopa since it is a self-administrable drug. However, physician services rendered in connection with its administration and control of its side effects are covered if determined to be reasonable and necessary. Initiation of L-Dopa therapy on an outpatient basis is possible in most cases. Visit frequency ranging from every week to every 2 or 3 months is acceptable. However, after half a year of therapy, visits more frequent than every month would usually not be reasonable.</p>","See the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 1 §30, Chapter 8 §50.5, and Chapter 6 §20.4.1.","","",,"","",25,"",False,2002-12-05 15:19:58,2022-03-17 17:10:47,2002-12-05 15:46:35,False,"Dopamine, amino acid, Parkinson's",False

<p> Where a physician establishes an office within a nursing home or other institution, coverage of services and supplies furnished in the office must be determined in accordance with the ""incident to a physician's professional service"" provision, as in any physician's office. A physician's office within an institution must be confined to a separately identified part of the facility which is used solely as the physician's office and cannot be construed to extend throughout the entire institution. Thus, services performed outside the ""office"" area would be subject to the coverage rules applicable to services furnished outside the office setting.
</p>","<p>In order to accurately apply the criteria in the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapters 6, &sect;20.4.1, or Chapter 15, “Covered Medical and Other Health Services,” &sect;60.1, the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) gives consideration to the physical proximity of the institution and physician’s office. When his office is located within a facility, a physician may not be reimbursed for services, supplies, and use of equipment which fall outside the scope of services “commonly furnished” in physician’s offices generally, even though such services may be furnished in his institutional office. Additionally, make a distinction between the physician’s office practice and the institution, especially when the physician is administrator or owner of the facility. Thus, for their services to be covered under the criteria in the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 6, &sect;20.4.1, or the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 15, “Covered Medical and Other Health Services,” &sect;60.1, the auxiliary medical personnel must be members of the office staff rather than of the institution’s staff, and the cost of supplies must represent an expense to the physician’s office practice. Finally, services performed by the employees of the physician outside the “office” area must be directly supervised by the physician; his presence in the facility as a whole would not suffice to meet this requirement. (In any setting, of course, supervision of auxiliary personnel in and of itself is not considered a “physician’s professional service” to which the services of the auxiliary personnel could be an incidental part, i.e., in addition to supervision, the physician must perform or have performed a personal professional service to the patient to which the services of the auxiliary personnel could be considered an incidental part.)  Denials for failure to meet any of these requirements would be based on &sect;1861(s)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act.</p>

<p>Establishment of an office within an institution would not modify rules otherwise applicable for determining coverage of the physician’s personal professional services within the institution. However, in view of the opportunity afforded to a physician who maintains such an office for rendering services to a sizable number of patients in a short period of time or for performing frequent services for the same patient, claims for physicians’ services rendered under such circumstances would require careful evaluation by the MAC to assure that payment is made only for services that are reasonable and necessary.</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 15, “Covered Medical and Other Health Services.”<br>

One group of these drugs, designated as Group C drugs, unlike other drugs distributed by the NCI, are not limited to use in clinical trials for the purpose of testing their efficacy. Drugs are classified as Group C drugs only if there is sufficient evidence demonstrating their efficacy within a tumor type and that they can be safely administered.</p>
","<p> A physician is eligible to receive Group C drugs from the Divison of Cancer Treatment only if the following requirements are met:</p>

<ul> 
<li> A physician must be registered with the NCI as an investigator by having completed an FD-Form 1573;</li>

<li> A written request for the drug, indicating the disease to be treated, must be submitted to the NCI;</li>

<li> The use of the drug must be limited to indications outlined in the NCI's guidelines; and</li>

<li> All adverse reactions must be reported to the Investigational Drug Branch of the Division of Cancer Treatment.</li>

Three to six months after radical prostatectomy, PSA is reported to provide a sensitive indicator of persistent disease. Six months following introduction of antiandrogen therapy, PSA is reported as capable of distinguishing patients with favorable response from those in whom limited response is anticipated.</p>    
    
<p>PSA when used in conjunction with other prostate cancer tests, such as digital rectal examination, may assist in the decision making process for diagnosing prostate cancer.

This test is also an aid in the management of prostate cancer patients and in detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients following treatment.</p>","<strong><p>    Indications</p> </strong>     
    
<p>PSA is of proven value in differentiating benign from malignant disease in men with lower urinary tract signs and symptoms (e.g., hematuria, slow urine stream, hesitancy, urgency, frequency, nocturia and incontinence) as well as with patients with palpably abnormal prostate glands on physician exam, and in patients with other laboratory or imaging studies that suggest the possibility of a malignant prostate disorder. PSA is also a marker used to follow the progress of prostate cancer once a diagnosis has been established, such as in detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients who may require additional treatment. PSA testing may also be useful in the differential diagnosis of men presenting with as yet undiagnosed disseminated metastatic disease.</p>    
    
<strong><p>     Limitations</p>  </strong>
    
<p>Generally, for patients with lower urinary tract signs or symptoms, the test is performed only once per year unless there is a change in the patient's medical condition.</p>    
    
<p>Testing with a diagnosis of in situ carcinoma is not reasonably done more frequently than once, unless the result is abnormal, in which case the test may be repeated once.</p>

Renal tubules, liver, and pancreas contain high amounts, although the measurement of GGT in serum is almost always used for assessment of hepatobiliary function. Unlike other enzymes which are found in heart, skeletal muscle, and intestinal mucosa as well as liver, the appearance of an elevated level of GGT in serum is almost always the result of liver disease or injury. It is specifically useful to differentiate elevated alkaline phosphatase levels when the source of the alkaline phosphatase increase (bone, liver, or placenta) is unclear. The combination of high alkaline phosphatase and a normal GGT does not, however, rule out liver disease completely.</p>    
    
<p>As well as being a very specific marker of hepatobiliary function, GGT is also a very sensitive marker for hepatocellular damage. Abnormal concentrations typically appear before elevations of other liver enzymes or bilirubin are evident. Obstruction of the biliary tract, viral infection (e.g., hepatitis, mononucleosis), metastatic cancer, exposure to hepatotoxins (e.g., organic solvents, drugs, alcohol), and use of drugs that induce microsomal enzymes in the liver (e.g., cimetidine, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) all can cause a moderate to marked increase in GGT serum concentration. In addition, some drugs can cause or exacerbate liver dysfunction (e.g., atorvastatin, troglitazone, and others as noted in FDA Contraindications and Warnings.)</p>    
    
<p>GGT is useful for diagnosis of liver disease or injury, exclusion of hepatobiliary involvement related to other diseases, and patient management during the resolution of existing disease or following injury.</p>","<strong><p>    Indications</p> </strong>  
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>To provide information about known or suspected hepatobiliary disease, for example:     
    
<ol type=""a"" start=""1"">    
<li>Following chronic alcohol or drug ingestion.</li>    
    
<li>Following exposure to hepatotoxins.</li>    
    
<li>When using medication known to have a potential for causing liver toxicity (e.g., following the drug manufacturer's recommendations).</li>    
    
<li>Following infection (e.g., viral hepatitis and other specific infections such as amoebiasis, tuberculosis, psittacosis, and similar infections).</li>    
</ol>    
</li>    
    
<li>To assess liver injury/function following diagnosis of primary or secondary malignant neoplasms.</li>    
    
<li>To assess liver injury/function in a wide variety of disorders and diseases known to cause liver involvement (e.g., diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, disorders of iron and mineral metabolism, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, and hypertension).</li>    
    
<li>To assess liver function related to gastrointestinal disease.</li>    
    
<li>To assess liver function related to pancreatic disease.</li>    
    
<li>To assess liver function in patients subsequent to liver transplantation.</li>    
    
<li>To differentiate between the different sources of elevated alkaline phosphatase activity.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<strong><p>     Limitations</p>  </strong>
    
<p>When used to assess liver dysfunction secondary to existing non-hepatobiliary disease with no change in signs, symptoms, or treatment, it is generally not necessary to repeat a GGT determination after a normal result has been obtained unless new indications are present.</p>    
    
<p>If the GGT is the only ""liver"" enzyme abnormally high, it is generally not necessary to pursue further evaluation for liver disease for this specific indication.</p>    
    
<p>When used to determine if other abnormal enzyme tests reflect liver abnormality rather than other tissue, it generally is not necessary to repeat a GGT more than one time per week.</p>    
    
<p>Because of the extreme sensitivity of GGT as a marker for cytochrome oxidase induction or cell membrane permeability, it is generally not useful in monitoring patients with known liver disease.</p>

<p><strong>A.  Definitions</p> </strong>
 
<p>1. Homologous Blood Transfusion</p>

<p>Homologous blood transfusion is the infusion of blood or blood components that have been collected from the general public.</p>

<p>2. Autologous Blood Transfusion</p>
	
	<p>An autologous blood transfusion is the precollection and subsequent infusion of a patient's own blood.</p>
 
<p>3. Donor Directed Blood Transfusion</p>

<p>A donor directed blood transfusion is the infusion of blood or blood components that have been precollected from a specific individual(s) other than the patient and subsequently infused into the specific patient for whom the blood is designated. For example, patient B's brother predeposits his blood for use by patient B during upcoming surgery.</p>

<p>4. Perioperative Blood Salvage</p>

<p>Perioperative blood salvage is the collection and reinfusion of blood lost during and immediately after surgery.</p>","<p><strong>B.  Policy Governing Transfusions</p> </strong>
 
<p> For Medicare coverage purposes, it is important to distinguish between a transfusion itself and preoperative blood services; e.g., collection, processing, storage. Medically necessary transfusion of blood, regardless of the type, may generally be a covered service under both Part A and Part B of Medicare. Coverage does not make a distinction between the transfusion of homologous, autologous, or donor-directed blood. With respect to the coverage of the services associated with the preoperative collection, processing, and storage of autologous and donor-directed blood, the following policies apply.</p> 
 
<p>1. Hospital Part A and B Coverage and Payment</p>

<p>Under <u>&#167;1862(a)(14) </u>of the Act, non-physician services furnished to hospital patients are covered and paid for as hospital services. As provided in <u>&#167;1886</u> of the Act, under the prospective payment system (PPS), the diagnosis related group (DRG) payment to the hospital includes all covered blood and blood processing expenses, whether or not the blood is eventually used.</p>

<p>In a situation where the hospital operates its own blood collection activities, rather than using an independent blood supplier, the costs incurred to collect autologous or donor-directed blood are recorded in the whole blood and packed red blood cells cost center. Because the blood has been replaced, Medicare does not recognize a charge for the blood itself. Under PPS, the DRG payment is intended to pay for all covered blood and blood services, whether or not the blood is eventually used.</p>

<p>Under its provider agreement, a hospital is required to furnish or arrange for all covered services furnished to hospital patients. Medicare payment is made to the hospital, under PPS or cost reimbursement, for covered inpatient and outpatient services, and it is intended to reflect payment for all costs of furnishing those services.</p>
 
<strong><p>2. Nonhospital Part B Coverage</p></strong>

<p>Under Part B, to be eligible for separate coverage, a service must fit the definition of one of the services authorized by <u>&#167;1832 </u>of the Act. These services are defined in <u>42 CFR 410.10</u> and do not include a separate category for a supplier's services associated with blood donation services, either autologous or donor-directed. That is, the collection, processing, and storage of blood for later transfusion into the beneficiary is not recognized as a separate service under Part B. Therefore, there is no avenue through which a blood supplier can receive direct payment under Part B for blood donation services.</p>

 
<strong><p>C.  Perioperative Blood Salvage</p> </strong>
 
<p> When the perioperative blood salvage process is used in surgery on a hospital patient, payment made to the hospital (under PPS or through cost reimbursement) for the procedure in which that process is used is intended to encompass payment for all costs relating to that process.</p>","","","72",1994-11-01 00:00:00,"","",25,"<p>   11/1994 - Clarified coverage and payment policies.

Iron is a critical structural component of hemoglobin, a key protein found in normal red blood cells (RBCs) which transports oxygen. Without this important building block, anemic patients experience difficulty in restoring adequate, healthy RBCs that improve hematocrit levels. Clinical management of iron deficiency involves treating patients with iron replacement products while they undergo hemodialysis. Body iron stores can be supplemented with either oral or intravenous (IV) iron products. The available evidence suggests that the mode of intravenous administration is perhaps the most effective treatment for iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients. Unlike oral iron products which must be absorbed through the GI tract, IV iron products are infused directly into the bloodstream in a form that is readily available to the bone marrow for RBC synthesis, resulting in an earlier correction of iron deficiency and anemia.</p>","<p>   Effective December 1, 2000, Medicare covers sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection as a first line treatment of iron deficiency anemia when furnished intravenously to patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis who are receiving supplemental erythropoeitin therapy.</p>

The following guidelines are designed to assist Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) in identifying and processing claims for such services.</p>","<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These new guidelines are limited to lithium battery-powered pacemakers, because mercury-zinc battery-powered pacemakers are no longer being manufactured and virtually all have been replaced by lithium units.  MACs still receiving claims for monitoring such units should continue to apply the guidelines published in 1980 to those units until they are replaced.</p>

<p>There are two general types of pacemakers in current use - single-chamber pacemakers which sense and pace the ventricles of the heart, and dual-chamber pacemakers which sense and pace both the atria and the ventricles. These differences require different monitoring patterns over the expected life of the units involved. One fact of which MACs should be aware is that many dual-chamber units may be programmed to pace only the ventricles; this may be done either at the time the pacemaker is implanted or at some time afterward. In such cases, a dual-chamber unit, when programmed or reprogrammed for ventricular pacing, should be treated as a single-chamber pacemaker in applying screening guidelines.</p>

<p>The decision as to how often any patient’s pacemaker should be monitored is the responsibility of the patient’s physician who is best able to take into account the condition and circumstances of the individual patient. These may vary over time, requiring modifications of the frequency with which the patient should be monitored. In cases where monitoring is done by some entity other than the patient’s physician, such as a commercial monitoring service or hospital outpatient department, the physician’s prescription for monitoring is required and should be periodically renewed (at least annually) to assure that the frequency of monitoring is proper for the patient. Where a patient is monitored both during clinic visits and transtelephonically, the MAC should be sure to include frequency data on both types of monitoring in evaluating the reasonableness of the frequency of monitoring services received by the patient. Since there are over 200 pacemaker models in service at any given point, and a variety of patient conditions that give rise to the need for pacemakers, the question of the appropriate frequency of monitoring is a complex one. Nevertheless, it is possible to develop guidelines within which the vast majority of pacemaker monitoring will fall and MACs should do this, using their own data and experience, as well as the frequency guidelines which follow, in order to limit extensive claims development to those cases requiring special attention.</p>","","","",,"","",25,"",False,2002-12-13 12:42:22,2017-01-20 12:21:57,2002-12-13 15:59:19,False,"",False

<p>Plethysmography is of value as a noninvasive technique for diagnostic, preoperative and postoperative evaluation of peripheral artery disease in the internal medicine or vascular surgery practice. It is also a useful tool for the preoperative podiatric evaluation of the diabetic patient or one who has intermittent claudication or other signs or symptoms indicative of peripheral vascular disease which have a bearing on the patient's candidacy for foot surgery.</p>

<p> The oldest form of plethysmography is the venous occlusive pneumoplethysmography. This method is cumbersome, time consuming, and requires considerable training to give useful, reproducible results. Nonetheless, in the setting of the hospital vascular laboratory, this technique is considered a reasonable and necessary procedure for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected peripheral arterial disease. It is unsuitable for routine use in the physician's office.</p>

<p> Recently, however, a number of other plethysmographic methods have been developed which make use of phenomena such as changes in electric impedance or changes in segmental blood pressure at constant volume to assess regional perfusion. Several of these methods have reached a level of development which makes them clinically valuable.</p>","<p> Medicare coverage is extended to those procedures listed in Category I below when used for the accepted medical indications mentioned above. The procedures in Category II are still considered experimental and are not covered at this time. Denial of claims because a noncovered procedure was used or because there was no medical indication for plethysmographic evaluation of any type should be based on &#167;1862(a)(1) of the Act.</p>

<p> <strong>Category I - Covered</strong></p>
 
<p> Segmental Plethysmography - Included under this procedure are services performed with a regional plethysmograph, differential plethysmograph, recording oscillometer, and a pulse volume recorder.</p>

<p> Electrical Impedance Plethysmography</p>

<p> Ultrasonic Measurement of Blood Flow (Doppler) - While not strictly a plethysmographic method, this is also a useful tool in the evaluation of suspected peripheral vascular disease or preoperative screening of podiatric patients with suspected peripheral vascular compromise. (See &#167;50-7 for the applicable coverage policy on this procedure.)</p>

<p> Oculoplethysmography - See NCD on&#160;Noninvasive Tests of Carotid Function, &#167;<a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=212&ncdver=1&DocID=20.17&kq=true&SearchType=Advanced&bc=EAAAAAgAAAAA&"">20.17</a>.</p>

<p> Strain Gauge Plethysmography - This test is based on recording the non-pulsatile aspects of inflowing blood at various points on an extremity by a mercury-in-silastic strain gauge sensor. The instrument consists of a chart recorder, an automatic cuff inflation and deflation system, and a recording manometer.</p>

<p> <strong>Category II - Experimental</strong></p>

<p> The following methods have not yet reached a level of development such as to allow their routine use in the evaluation of suspected peripheral vascular disease.</p>

 <p> Inductance Plethysmography - This method is considered experimental and does not provide reproducible results.</p>

<p> Capacitance Plethysmography - This method is considered experimental and does not provide reproducible results.</p>

<p> Mechanical Oscillometry - This is a non-standardized method which offers poor sensitivity and is not considered superior to the simple measurement of peripheral blood pressure.</p>

<p> Photoelectric Plethysmography - This method is considered useful only in determining whether or not a pulse is present and does not provide reproducible measurements of blood flow.</p>
<p>Differential plethysmography, on the other hand, is a system which uses an impedance technique to compare pulse pressures at various points along a limb, with a reference pressure at the mid-brachial or wrist level. It is not clear whether this technique, as usually performed in the physician's office, meets the definition of plethysmography because quantitative measurements of blood flow are usually not made. It has been concluded, in any event, that the differential plethysmography system is a blood pulse recorder of undetermined value, which has the potential for significant overutilization. Therefore, reimbursement for studies done by techniques other than venous occlusive pneumoplethysmography should be denied, at least until additional data on these devices, including controlled clinical studies, become available.</p>","","","",,"","",25,"",False,2002-12-13 14:28:23,2024-12-02 14:29:10,2002-12-13 15:59:18,False,"lung plethysmography, pulmonary function test",False

<ul>    
<li>Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM Antibody;</li>    
    
<li>Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), IgM Antibody;</li>    
    
<li>Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); and</li>    
    
<li>Hepatitis C antibody.</li>    
</ul>    
    
<p>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses, drugs, toxins, and other etiologies. Viral hepatitis can be due to one of at least five different viruses, designated Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Most cases are caused by Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV).</p>    
    
<p>HAV is the most common cause of hepatitis in children and adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a positive IgG anti-HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti-HAV, which typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears within three months of its appearance. IgG anti-HAV is similar in the timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection indicates prior effective immunization or recovery from infection. Although HAV is spread most commonly by fecal-oral exposure, parenteral infection is possible during the acute viremia stage of the disease. After exposure, standard immune globulin may be effective as a prophylaxis.</p>    
    
<p>HBV produces three separate antigens (surface, core, and e (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel. Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel: hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)-IgM antibody , HBsAg is the earlier marker, appearing in serum four to eight weeks after exposure, and typically disappearing within six months after its appearance. If HBsAg remains detectable for greater than six months, this indicates chronic HBV infection. HBcAb, in the form of both IgG and IgM antibodies, are next to appear in serum, typically becoming detectable two to three months following exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or disappears entirely one to two years following exposure, but the IgG usually remains detectable for life. Because HBsAg is present for a relatively short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does not exclude an HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a much higher titer and remains elevated for a longer period of time, but a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be the result of a prior infection. The last marker to appear in the course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appears in serum four to six months following exposure, remains positive indefinitely, and confers immunity. HBV is spread exclusively by exposure to infected blood or body fluids; in the U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30% to 60% of new cases of HBV infection.</p>    
    
<p>The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is best established by documentation of a positive IgM antibody against the core antigen (HBcAb-IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established primarily by identifying a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG antibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAb-IgG). Additional tests such as Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope antigen and antibody, are not included in the Hepatitis Panel, but may be of importance in assessing the infectivity of patients with HBV. Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAb alone may be used monthly for up to six months, or until a positive result is obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response.</p>    
    
<p>HCV is the most common cause of post-transfusion hepatitis; overall HCV is responsible for 15% to 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis, and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodies, which appear in blood two to four months after infection. False positive HCV results can occur. For example, a patient with a recent yeast infection may produce a false positive anti-HCV result. For this reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively through exposure to infected blood or body fluids.</p>    
    
<p>This panel of tests is used for differential diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of liver disease or injury. When the time of exposure or the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued symptoms of liver disease despite a completely negative Hepatitis Panel may need a repeat panel approximately two weeks to two months later to exclude the possibility of hepatitis. Once a diagnosis is established, specific tests can be used to monitor the course of the disease.</p>","<strong><p>    Indications</p> </strong> 
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>To detect viral hepatitis infection when there are abnormal liver function test results, with or without signs or symptoms of hepatitis.</li>    
    
<li>Prior to and subsequent to liver transplantation.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<strong><p>     Limitations</p>  </strong>
    
<p>After a hepatitis diagnosis has been established, only individual tests, rather than the entire panel, are needed.</p>

The procedure is performed by testing one or several small samples of one, two or three different stool specimens.</p>    
    
<p>This test may be performed with or without evidence of iron deficiency anemia, which may be related to gastrointestinal blood loss. The range of causes for blood loss include inflammatory causes, including acid-peptic disease, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, hiatal hernia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroenteritis, strongyloides, ascariasis, tuberculosis, and enteroamebiasis.  Vascular causes include angiodysplasia, hemangiomas, varices, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, and watermelon stomach. Tumors and neoplastic causes include lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, lipomas, adenocarcinoma and primary and secondary metastases to the GI tract. Drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also cause bleeding. There are extra gastrointestinal causes such as hemoptysis, epistaxis, and oropharyngeal bleeding. Artifactual causes include hematuria, and menstrual bleeding. In addition, there may be other causes such as coagulopathies, gastrostomy tubes or other appliances, factitial causes, and long distance running.</p>    
    
<p>Three basic types of fecal hemoglobin assays exist, each directed at a different component of the hemoglobin molecule.</p>    
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>Immunoassays recognize antigenic sites on the globin portion and are least affected by diet or proximal gut bleeding, but the antigen may be destroyed by fecal flora.</li>    
    
<li>The heme-porphyrin assay measures heme-derived porphyrin and is least influenced by enterocolic metabolism or fecal storage. This assay does not discriminate dietary from endogenous heme. The capacity to detect proximal gut bleeding reduces its specificity for colorectal cancer screening but makes it more useful for evaluating overall GI bleeding in case finding for iron deficiency anemia.</li>    
    
<li>The guaiac-based test is the most widely used. It requires the peroxidase activity of an intact heme moiety to be reactive. Positivity rates fall with storage. Fecal hydration such as adding a drop of water increases the test reactivity but also increases false positivity.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<p>Of these three tests, the guaiac-based test is the most sensitive for detecting lower bowel bleeding. Because of this sensitivity, it is advisable, when it is used for screening, to defer the guaiac-based test if other studies of the colon are performed prior to the test. Similarly, this test's sensitivity may result in a false positive if the patient has recently ingested meat. Both of these cautions are appropriate when the test is used for screening, but when appropriate indications are present, the test should be done despite its limitations.</p>","<strong><p>    Indications</p> </strong>  
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>To evaluate known or suspected alimentary tract conditions that might cause bleeding into the intestinal tract.</li>    
    
<li>To evaluate unexpected anemia.</li>    
    
<li>To evaluate abnormal signs, symptoms, or complaints that might be associated with loss of blood.</li>    
    
<li>To evaluate patient complaints of black or red-tinged stools.</li>    
</ol>    
    
<strong><p>     Limitations</p>  </strong>    
    
<ol start=""1"">    
<li>The FOBT is reported once for the testing of up to three separate specimens (comprising either one or two tests per specimen).</li>    
    
<li>In patients who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding but no other signs, symptoms, or complaints associated with gastrointestinal blood loss, testing for occult blood may generally be appropriate no more than once every three months.</li>    </ol>   
    
<p>When testing is done for the purpose of screening for colorectal cancer in the absence of signs, symptoms, conditions, or complaints associated with gastrointestinal blood loss, report the HCPCS code for colorectal cancer screening; fecal-occult blood test, 1-3 simultaneous determinations should be used.</p>

<p>When used in the home, oxygen and oxygen equipment can make meaningful contributions to the treatment of patients with both acute and chronic conditions who require the medical gas on either a short- or long-term basis.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>
<p>Oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment is covered in the home for acute or chronic conditions, short- or long- term, when the patient exhibits hypoxemia as defined below.</p>
<p>Initial claims for oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients must be based on the results of a clinical test that has been ordered and evaluated by the treating practitioner. Such a test is usually in the form of a measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood. A measurement of arterial oxygen saturation obtained by ear or pulse oximetry, however, is also acceptable when ordered and evaluated by the treating practitioner and performed under his or her supervision or when performed by a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services. A durable medical equipment (DME) supplier is not considered a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services for purposes of this National Coverage Determination (NCD). This prohibition does not extend to the results of blood gas tests conducted by a hospital certified to do such tests.</p>

<p>When the arterial blood gas and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for home oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting, the arterial blood gas study is the preferred source of documenting medical need.</p>

<p>Required qualifying arterial blood gas or oximetry studies must be performed at the time of need. The time of need is defined as during the patient’s illness when the presumption is that the provision of oxygen in the home setting will improve the patient’s condition. For an inpatient hospital patient the time of need is within 2 days of discharge. For those patients whose initial oxygen prescription does not originate during an inpatient hospital stay, the time of need is during the period when the treating practitioner notes signs and symptoms of illness that can be relieved by oxygen in the patient who is to be treated at home.</p>
<p>Patients exhibiting hypoxemia are defined using the clinical criteria below:</p>

<p>Group I:</p>
<ul><li>An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or below 88%, taken at rest, breathing room air;or</li>
<li>An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or below 88%, taken during sleep for a patient who demonstrates an arterial PO2 at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or above 89%, while awake; or a greater than normal fall in oxygen level during sleep (a decrease in arterial PO2 more than 10 mm Hg, or decrease in arterial oxygen saturation more than 5%) associated with symptoms or signs reasonably attributable to hypoxemia (e.g., impairment of cognitive processes and nocturnal restlessness or insomnia). In either of these cases, coverage is provided only for use of oxygen during sleep, and then only one type of unit will be covered. Portable oxygen, therefore, would not be covered in this situation; or,</li>
<li>An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation at or below 88%, taken during exercise [defined as either the functional performance of the patient or a formal exercise test], for a patient who demonstrates an arterial PO2 at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at or above 89%, during the day while at rest. In this case, supplemental oxygen is provided for during exercise if the use of oxygen improves the hypoxemia that was demonstrated during exercise when the patient was breathing room air.</li></ul>

<p>Group II: Coverage is available for patients whose arterial PO2 is 56-59 mm Hg or whose arterial blood oxygen saturation is 89%, if there is:</p>

<ul><li>Dependent edema suggesting congestive heart failure; or,</li>
<li>Pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale, determined by measurement of pulmonary artery pressure, gated blood pool scan, echocardiogram, or ""P"" pulmonale on EKG (P wave greater than 3 mm in standard leads II, III, or AVFL; or,</li>
<li>Erythrocythemia with a hematocrit greater than 56%.</li></ul>

<p>In reviewing the arterial PO2 levels and the arterial oxygen saturation percentages specified above, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) must take into account variations in oxygen measurements that may result from such factors as the patient's age, the patient’s skin pigmentation, the altitude level, or the patient's decreased oxygen carrying capacity.</p>

<strong><p>C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will not cover oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment in the home in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul><li>Angina pectoris in the absence of hypoxemia. This condition is generally not the result of a low oxygen level in the blood, and there are other preferred treatments; or,</li>
<li>Breathlessness without cor pulmonale or evidence of hypoxemia. Although intermittent oxygen use is sometimes prescribed to relieve this condition, it is potentially harmful and psychologically addicting; or, </li>
<li>Severe peripheral vascular disease resulting in clinically evident desaturation in one or more extremities. There is no evidence that increased PO2 improves the oxygenation of tissues with impaired circulation; or,</li>
	<li>Terminal illnesses unless they affect the ability to breathe.</li></ul>


<p><strong>D. Other</strong></p>
<p>The MAC may determine reasonable and necessary coverage of oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment in the home for patients who are not described in subsection B or precluded by subsection C of this NCD. Initial coverage for patients with other conditions may be limited to the shorter of 90 days or the number of days included in the practitioner prescription at MAC discretion. Oxygen coverage may be renewed if deemed medically necessary by the MAC.</p>
<p>MACs may also allow beneficiaries who are mobile in the home and would benefit from the use of a portable oxygen system in the home to qualify for coverage of a portable oxygen system either (1) by itself, or, (2) to use in addition to a stationary oxygen system.</p>

In diabetes, sensory neuropathy is an anatomically diffuse process primarily affecting sensory and autonomic fibers; however, distal motor findings may be present in advanced cases. Long nerves are affected first, with symptoms typically beginning insidiously in the toes and then advancing proximally. This leads to loss of protective sensation (LOPS), whereby a person is unable to feel minor trauma from mechanical, thermal, or chemical sources. When foot lesions are present, the reduction in autonomic nerve functions may also inhibit wound healing.</p>","<p>   Diabetic sensory neuropathy with LOPS is a localized illness of the feet and falls within the regulation's exception to the general exclusionary rule (see 42&#160;CFR&#160;&#167;411.15(l)(1)(i)). Foot exams for people with diabetic sensory neuropathy with LOPS are reasonable and necessary to allow for early intervention in serious complications that typically afflict diabetics with the disease.</p>

<p>   Effective for services furnished on or after July 1, 2002, Medicare covers, as a physician service, an evaluation (examination and treatment) of the feet no more often than every six months for individuals with a documented diagnosis of diabetic sensory neuropathy and LOPS, as long as the beneficiary has not seen a foot care specialist for some other reason in the interim. LOPS shall be diagnosed through sensory testing with the 5.07 monofilament using established guidelines, such as those developed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases guidelines. Five sites should be tested on the plantar surface of each foot, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases guidelines. The areas must be tested randomly since the loss of protective sensation may be patchy in distribution, and the patient may get clues if the test is done rhythmically. Heavily callused areas should be avoided. As suggested by the American Podiatric Medicine Association, an absence of sensation at two or more sites out of 5 tested on either foot when tested with the 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament must be present and documented to diagnose peripheral neuropathy with loss of protective sensation.</p>

<p>  Coverage of NMES to treat muscle atrophy is limited to the treatment of disuse atrophy where nerve supply to the muscle is intact, including brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, and other non-neurological reasons for disuse atrophy. Some examples would be casting or splinting of a limb, contracture due to scarring of soft tissue as in burn lesions, and hip replacement surgery (until orthotic training begins).

Coverage for the use of NMES/FES is limited to SCI patients for walking, who have completed a training program which consists of at least 32 physical therapy sessions with the device over a period of three months. The trial period of physical therapy will enable the physician treating the patient for his or her spinal cord injury to properly evaluate the person's ability to use these devices frequently and for the long term. Physical therapy necessary to perform this training must be directly performed by the physical therapist as part of a one-on-one training program.</p>

<p>   CT scans have become the primary diagnostic tool for many conditions and symptoms. CT scanning used as the primary diagnostic tool can be cost effective because it can eliminate the need for a series of other tests, is non-invasive and thus virtually eliminates complications, and does not require hospitalization.</p>","<strong><p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determining Whether a CT Scan Is Reasonable and Necessary</p></strong>

<p>Sufficient information must be provided with claims to differentiate CT scans from other radiology services and to make coverage determinations. Carefully review claims to ensure that a scan is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient; i.e., the use must be found to be medically appropriate considering the patient’s symptoms and preliminary diagnosis.</p>

<p>There is no general rule that requires other diagnostic tests to be tried before CT scanning is used. However, in an individual case the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) medical staff may determine that use of a CT scan as the initial diagnostic test was not reasonable and necessary because it was not supported by the patient’s symptoms or complaints stated on the claim form; e.g., “periodic headaches.""</p>

<p>Claims for CT scans are reviewed for evidence of abuse, which might include the absence of reasonable indications for the scans, an excessive number of scans, or unnecessarily expensive types of scans considering the facts in the particular cases.</p>

<strong><p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria for Approval</p></strong>

<p>In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the MAC may assume that a CT scan for which payment is requested has been performed on equipment that meets the following criteria:</p>

<ol start=""a"" type=""a"">
<li>The model must be known to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and</li>

<p>CT scans performed on mobile units are subject to the same Medicare coverage requirements applicable to scans performed on stationary units, as well as certain health and safety requirements recommended by the Health Resources and Services Administration. As with scans performed on stationary units, the scans must be determined medically necessary for the individual patient. The scans must be performed on types of CT scanning equipment that have been approved for use as stationary units (see C above), and must be in compliance with applicable State laws and regulations for control of radiation.</p>


<strong><p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital Setting</p></strong>
<p>The hospital must assume responsibility for the quality of the scan furnished to inpatients and outpatients and must ensure that a radiologist or other qualified physician is in charge of the procedure. The radiologist or other physician (i.e., one who is with the mobile unit) who is responsible for the procedure must be approved by the hospital for similar privileges.</p>

<strong><p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambulatory Setting</p></strong>
<p>If mobile CT scan services are furnished at an ambulatory health care facility other than a hospital-based facility, e.g., a freestanding physician-directed clinic, the diagnostic procedure must be performed by, or under the direct personal supervision of, a radiologist or other qualified physician. In addition, the facility must maintain a record of the attending physician’s order for a scan performed on a mobile unit.</p>

<strong><p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billing for Mobile CT Scans</p></strong>
<p>Hospitals, hospital-associated radiologists, ambulatory health care facilities, and physician owner/operators of mobile units may bill for mobile scans as they would for scans performed on stationary equipment.</p>

<strong><p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims Review</p></strong>
<p>Evidence of compliance with applicable State laws and regulations for control of radiation should be requested from owners of mobile CT scan units upon receipt of the first claims. All mobile scan claims should be reviewed very carefully in accordance with instructions applicable to scans performed on fixed units, with particular emphasis on the medical necessity for scans performed in an ambulatory setting.</p>

<strong><p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-Planar Diagnostic Imaging (MPDI)</p></strong>
<p>In usual CT scanning procedures, a series of transverse or axial images are reproduced. These transverse images are routinely translated into coronal and/or sagittal views. MPDI is a process which further translates the data produced by CT scanning by providing reconstructed oblique images which can contribute to diagnostic information. MPDI, also known as planar image reconstruction or reformatted imaging, is covered under Medicare when provided as a service to an entity performing a covered CT scan.</p>

<strong>  <p>  1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Operation</p></strong> 

<p>  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), formerly called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is a non-invasive method of graphically representing the distribution of water and other hydrogen-rich molecules in the human body. In contrast to conventional radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans, in which the image is produced by x-ray beam attenuation by an object, MRI is capable of producing images by several techniques. In fact, various combinations of MRI image production methods may be employed to emphasize particular characteristics of the tissue or body part being examined. The basic elements by which MRI produces an image are the density of hydrogen nuclei in the object being examined, their motion, and the relaxation times, and the period of time required for the nuclei to return to their original states in the main, static magnetic field after being subjected to a brief additional magnetic field. These relaxation times reflect the physical-chemical properties of tissue and the molecular environment of its hydrogen nuclei. Only hydrogen atoms are present in human tissues in sufficient concentration for current use in clinical MRI.</p> 
 
<p>  Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a non-invasive diagnostic test that is an application of MRI. By analyzing the amount of energy released from tissues exposed to a strong magnetic field, MRA provides images of normal and diseased blood vessels, as well as visualization and quantification of blood flow through these vessels.</p> 
 
<strong>  <p>  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Clinical Utility</p></strong> 

<p>  Overall, MRI is a useful diagnostic imaging modality that is capable of demonstrating a wide variety of soft-tissue lesions with contrast resolution equal or superior to CT scanning in various parts of the body.</p> 
 
<p>  Among the advantages of MRI are the absence of ionizing radiation and the ability to achieve high levels of tissue contrast resolution without injected iodinated radiological contrast agents. Recent advances in technology have resulted in development and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of new paramagnetic contrast agents for MRI which allow even better visualization in some instances. Multi-slice imaging and the ability to image in multiple planes, especially sagittal and coronal, have provided flexibility not easily available with other modalities. Because cortical (outer layer) bone and metallic prostheses do not cause distortion of MR images, it has been possible to visualize certain lesions and body regions with greater certainty than has been possible with CT. The use of MRI on certain soft tissue structures for the purpose of detecting disruptive, neoplastic, degenerative, or inflammatory lesions has now become established in medical practice.</p> 
 
<p>  Phase contrast (PC) and time-of-flight (TOF) are some of the available MRA techniques at the time these instructions are being issued. PC measures the difference between the phases of proton spins in tissue and blood and measures both the venous and arterial blood flow at any point in the cardiac cycle. TOF measures the difference between the amount of magnetization of tissue and blood and provides information on the structure of blood vessels, thus indirectly indicating blood flow. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images can be obtained using each method.</p> 

<p>  Contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) involves blood flow imaging after the patient receives an intravenous injection of a contrast agent. Gadolinium, a non-ionic element, is the foundation of all contrast agents currently in use. Gadolinium affects the way in which tissues respond to magnetization, resulting in better visualization of structures when compared to un-enhanced studies. Unlike ionic (i.e., iodine-based) contrast agents used in conventional contrast angiography (CA), allergic reactions to gadolinium are extremely rare. Additionally, gadolinium does not cause the kidney failure occasionally seen with ionic contrast agents. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a computer-augmented form of CA that obtains digital blood flow images as contrast agent courses through a blood vessel. The computer “subtracts” bone and other tissue from the image, thereby improving visualization of blood vessels. Physicians elect to use a specific MRA or CA technique based upon clinical information from each patient.</p>","<strong><p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered MRI and MRA Indications</p></strong> 

<strong>  <p>  1. &nbsp;&nbsp;MRI</p></strong> 
 
<p>  Although several uses of MRI are still considered investigational and some uses are clearly contraindicated (see subsection C), MRI is considered medically efficacious for a number of uses. Use the following descriptions as general guidelines or examples of what may be considered covered rather than as a restrictive list of specific covered indications. Coverage is limited to MRI units that have received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved.</p> 
 
<ol type=""a""> 
<li>MRI is useful in examining the head, central nervous system, and spine. Multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed with MRI and the contents of the posterior fossa are visible. The inherent tissue contrast resolution of MRI makes it an appropriate standard diagnostic modality for general neuroradiology.</li> 
 
<li>MRI can assist in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses, including abnormalities of the large vessels such as aneurysms and dissection. When a clinical need exists to visualize the parenchyma of solid organs to detect anatomic disruption or neoplasia, this can be accomplished in the liver, urogenital system, adrenals, and pelvic organs without the use of radiological contrast materials. When MRI is considered reasonable and necessary, the use of paramagnetic contrast materials may be covered as part of the study. MRI may also be used to detect and stage pelvic and retroperitoneal neoplasms and to evaluate disorders of cancellous bone and soft tissues. It may also be used in the detection of pericardial thickening. Primary and secondary bone neoplasm and aseptic necrosis can be detected at an early stage and monitored with MRI. Patients with metallic prostheses, especially of the hip, can be imaged in order to detect the early stages of infection of the bone to which the prosthesis is attached.</li> 
 
<li>MRI may also be covered to diagnose disc disease without regard to whether radiological imaging has been tried first to diagnose the problem.</li> 
<li>MRI with gating devices and surface coils, and gating devices that eliminate distorted images caused by cardiac and respiratory movement cycles are now considered state of the art techniques and may be covered. Surface and other specialty coils may also be covered, as they are used routinely for high resolution imaging where small limited regions of the body are studied. They produce high signal-to-noise ratios resulting in images of enhanced anatomic detail.</li></ol> 
 
<strong>  <p>  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;MRA (MRI for Blood Flow)</p></strong> 

<p>Currently covered indications include using MRA for specific conditions to evaluate flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck, peripheral arteries of lower extremities, abdomen and pelvis, and the chest. Coverage is limited to MRA units that have received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved.</p> 
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>Head and Neck <br>
<p>Studies have proven that MRA is effective for evaluating flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck. However, not all potential applications of MRA have been shown to be reasonable and necessary. All of the following criteria must apply in order for Medicare to provide coverage for MRA of the head and neck:</p> 
 
<ul><li type=""disc"">MRA is used to evaluate the carotid arteries, the circle of Willis, the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral arteries, the vertebral or basilar arteries or the venous sinuses;</li><br> 
 
<li type=""disc"">MRA is performed on patients with conditions of the head and neck for which surgery is anticipated and may be found to be appropriate based on the MRA. These conditions include, but are not limited to, tumor, aneurysms, vascular malformations, vascular occlusion or thrombosis. Within this broad category of disorders, medical necessity is the underlying determinant of the need for an MRA in specific diseases. The medical records should clearly justify and demonstrate the existence of medical necessity; and</li><br>
 
<li type=""disc"">MRA and CA are not expected to be performed on the same patient for diagnostic purposes prior to the application of anticipated therapy. Only one of these tests will be covered routinely unless the physician can demonstrate the medical need to perform both tests.</li></ul><br> </li>
 
<li>Peripheral Arteries of Lower Extremities<br>

<p>Studies have proven that MRA of peripheral arteries is useful in determining the presence and extent of peripheral vascular disease in lower extremities. This procedure is non-invasive and has been shown to find occult vessels in some patients for which those vessels were not apparent when CA was performed. Medicare will cover either MRA or CA to evaluate peripheral arteries of the lower extremities. However, both MRA and CA may be useful in some cases, such as:</p> 
 
<ul><li type=""disc""> A patient has had CA and this test was unable to identify a viable run-off vessel for bypass. When exploratory surgery is not believed to be a reasonable medical course of action for this patient, MRA may be performed to identify the viable runoff vessel; or</li><br> 
 
<li type=""disc"">A patient has had MRA, but the results are inconclusive.</li></ul><br> </li> 
 
<li>Abdomen and Pelvis <br><br>
  
<ol start=""1"" type=""i""><li>Pre-operative Evaluation of Patients Undergoing Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair <br>
 
<p>MRA is covered for pre-operative evaluation of patients undergoing elective AAA repair if the scientific evidence reveals MRA is considered comparable to CA in determining the extent of AAA, as well as in evaluating aortoiliac occlusion disease and renal artery pathology that may be necessary in the surgical planning of AAA repair. These studies also reveal that MRA could provide a net benefit to the patient. If preoperative CA is avoided, then patients are not exposed to the risks associated with invasive procedures, contrast media, end-organ damage, or arterial injury. </p></li>
 
<li>Imaging the Renal Arteries and the Aortoiliac Arteries in the Absence of AAA or Aortic Dissection <br>
 
<p>MRA coverage is expanded to include imaging the renal arteries and the aortoiliac arteries in the absence of AAA or aortic dissection. MRA should be obtained in those circumstances in which using MRA is expected to avoid obtaining CA, when physician history, physical examination, and standard assessment tools provide insufficient information for patient management, and obtaining an MRA has a high probability of positively affecting patient management. However, CA may be ordered after obtaining the results of an MRA in those rare instances where medical necessity is demonstrated. </p>
</li></ol></li>
 
<li>Chest<br><br>
 
<ol start=""1"" type=""i""><li>Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism <br>
 
<p>Current scientific data has shown that diagnostic pulmonary MRAs are improving due to recent developments such as faster imaging capabilities and gadolinium-enhancement. However, these advances in MRA are not significant enough to warrant replacement of pulmonary angiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism for patients who have no contraindication to receiving intravenous iodinated contrast material. Patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast material face a high risk of developing complications if they undergo pulmonary angiography or computed tomography angiography. Therefore, Medicare will cover MRA of the chest for diagnosing a suspected pulmonary embolism when it is contraindicated for the patient to receive intravascular iodinated contrast material. </p></li>
 
<li>Evaluation of Thoracic Aortic Dissection and Aneurysm <br>
 
<p>  Studies have shown that MRA of the chest has a high level of diagnostic accuracy for pre-operative and post-operative evaluation of aortic dissection of aneurysm. Depending on the clinical presentation, MRA may be used as an alternative to other non-invasive imaging technologies, such as transesophageal echocardiography and CT. Generally, Medicare will provide coverage only for MRA or for CA when used as a diagnostic test. However, if both MRA and CA of the chest are used, the physician must demonstrate the medical need for performing these tests. </p>
 
<p>  While the intent of this policy is to provide reimbursement for either MRA or CA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is also allowing flexibility for physicians to make appropriate decisions concerning the use of these tests based on the needs of individual patients. CMS anticipates, however, low utilization of the combined use of MRA and CA. As a result, CMS encourages the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to monitor the use of these tests and, where indicated, require evidence of the need to perform both MRA and CA. </p>

<ol start=""1"" type=""i"">
<li>An MRI is covered when used according to the FDA labeling in an MRI environment for patients with an implanted pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P), or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D).</li><br>
<li>Any MRI for patients with an implanted pacemaker, ICD, CRT-P, or CRT-D that does not have FDA labeling specific to use in an MRI environment is only covered under the following conditions:<br><br>
<ol start=""1"" type=""a""><li>MRI field strength is 1.5 Tesla using Normal Operating Mode;</li>
<li>The implanted pacemaker, ICD, CRT-P, or CRT-D system has no fractured, epicardial, or abandoned leads;</li>

<li>a qualified physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant with expertise with implanted pacemakers, ICDs, CRT-Ps, or CRT-Ds must directly supervise the MRI scan as defined in 42 CFR § §410.28 and 410.32;</li>
<li>patients are observed throughout the MRI scan via visual and voice contact and monitored with equipment to assess vital signs and cardiac rhythm;</li>
<li>an advanced cardiac life support provider must be present for the duration of the MRI scan;</li>
<li>a discharge plan that includes before being discharged from the hospital/facility, the patient is evaluated and the implanted pacemaker, ICD, CRT-P, or CRT-D is reinterrogated immediately after the MRI scan to detect and correct any abnormalities that might have developed.</li></ul></ol></ol>

<strong>  <p>  C. &nbsp;&nbsp;Contraindications and Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p></strong> 

<strong>  <p>  1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Contraindications</p></strong> 
 
<p>  The MRI is not covered when the following patient-specific contraindications are present</p> 

<ul><li>MRI during a viable pregnancy.</li><br>
<li>The danger inherent in bringing ferromagnetic materials within range of MRI units generally constrains the use of MRI on acutely ill patients requiring life support systems and monitoring devices that employ ferromagnetic materials.</li><br>
<li>The long imaging time and the enclosed position of the patient may result in claustrophobia, making patients who have a history of claustrophobia unsuitable candidates for MRI procedures.</li></ul>
 
<strong>  <p>  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p></strong> 

<p>CMS has determined that MRI of cortical bone and calcifications, and procedures involving spatial resolution of bone and calcifications, are not considered reasonable and necessary indications within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act, and are therefore non-covered.</p>

<p>MRI is not covered for patients with metallic clips on vascular aneurysms.</p>
 
<p>  <strong>  D. &nbsp;&nbsp;Other</strong></p> 

<p> All other uses of MRI or MRA for which CMS has not specifically indicated coverage or non-coverage continue to be eligible for coverage through individual local MAC discretion.</p>

<p>  08/2011 - Effective for claims with dates of service on or after July 7, 2011, CMS believes that the evidence is adequate to conclude that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with implanted permanent pacemakers (PMs) when the PMs are used according to the FDA-approved labeling for use in an MRI environment. Other contraindications that may be present in any given beneficiary would continue to apply in patients with PMs. These other contraindications are listed in section 220.2.C.1 of the National Coverage Determinations (NCD) manual and referenced in CR 7296.

<p> 03/2011 - Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 24, 2011, CMS will allow for coverage of MRI for Medicare beneficiaries with implanted PMs or ICDs when those beneficiaries are enrolled in clinical studies that are approved by CMS for the purpose of gaining further evidence about the utility and safety of MRI exposure. Coverage under the coverage with evidence development (CED) paradigm is also contingent on all the criteria at section 220.2.C.1 of the NCD Manual being met.

<p> 07/2010 - MRA is a specific application of MRI. CMS believes that the continued existence of separate NCDs is unnecessary, and that the provisions of the MRA NCD at section 220.3, should be merged under the NCD for MRI at section 220.2. Thus, section 220.3, MRA, will no longer appear as a separate NCD. The effect of this change will maintain existing national coverage for both MRI and MRA, and will eliminate the non-coverage language that currently exists for MRA at section 220.3, thereby permitting local Medicare contractors to cover (or not cover) all indications of MRA (and MRI) that are not specifically nationally covered or nationally non-covered.

<ol start=""1"">
<li><p>An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a graphic representation of electrical activity within the heart. Electrodes placed on the body in predetermined locations sense this electrical activity, which is then recorded by various means for review and interpretation. EKG recordings are used to diagnose a wide range of heart disease and other conditions that manifest themselves by abnormal cardiac electrical activity.</p>

<p>EKG services are covered diagnostic tests when there are documented signs and symptoms or other clinical indications for providing the service. Coverage includes the review and interpretation of EKGs only by a physician. There is no coverage for EKG services when rendered as a screening test or as part of a routine examination unless performed as part of the one-time, “Welcome to Medicare” preventive physical examination under section 611 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.</p></li>

<li><p>Ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) refers to services rendered in an outpatient setting over a specified period of time, generally while a patient is engaged in daily activities, including sleep. AECG devices are intended to provide the physician with documented episodes of arrhythmia, which may not be detected using a standard 12-lead EKG. AECG is most typically used to evaluate symptoms that may correlate with intermittent cardiac arrhythmias and/or myocardial ischemia. Such symptoms include syncope, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. Additionally, AECG is used to evaluate patient response to initiation, revision, or discontinuation of arrhythmic drug therapy.</p></li>

<li><p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), through the national coverage determination (NCD) process, may create new ambulatory EKG monitoring device categories if published, peer-reviewed clinical studies demonstrate evidence of improved clinical utility, or equal utility with additional advantage to the patient, as indicated by improved patient management and/or improved health outcomes in the Medicare population (such as superior ability to detect serious or life-threatening arrhythmias) as compared to devices or services in the currently described categories below.</p></li>
</ol>

<strong><p>Descriptions of Ambulatory EKG Monitoring Technologies</p></strong>

<ol start=""1"">
<li><p>Dynamic electrocardiography devices that continuously record a real-time EKG, commonly known as Holter&#8482; monitors, typically record over a 24-hour period. The recording is captured either on a magnetic tape or other digital medium. The data is then computer-analyzed at a later time, and a physician interprets the computer-generated report. A 24-hour recording is generally adequate to detect most transient arrhythmias. Documentation of medical necessity is required for monitoring longer than 24 hours. The recording device itself is not covered as durable medical equipment (DME) separate from the total diagnostic service.</p></li>

<li><p>An event monitor, or event recorder, is a patient-activated or event-activated EKG device that intermittently records cardiac arrhythmic events as they occur. The EKG is recorded on magnetic tape or other digital medium.</p>

<p>Cardiac event monitor technology varies among different devices. For patient-activated event monitors, the patient initiates recording when symptoms appear or when instructed to do so by a physician (e.g., following exercise). For self-sensing, automatically triggered monitors, an EKG is automatically recorded when the device detects an arrhythmia, without patient intervention. Some devices permit a patient to transmit EKG data transtelephonically (i.e., via telephone) to a receiving center where the data is reviewed. A technician may be available at these centers to review transmitted data 24 hours per day. In some instances, when the EKG is determined to be outside certain pre-set criteria by a technician or other non-physician, a physician is available 24 hours per day to review the transmitted data and to make clinical decisions regarding the patient. These services are known as “24-hour attended monitoring”. In other instances, transmitted EKG data is reviewed at a later time and are, therefore, considered “non-attended.”</p>

<p>Cardiac event monitors without transtelephonic capability must be removed from the patient and taken to a location for review of the stored EKG data. Some devices also permit a ""time sampling"" mode of operation. The ""time sampling"" mode is not covered under ambulatory EKG monitoring technology. Some cardiac event monitoring devices with trans-telephonic capabilities require the patient to dial the phone number of a central EKG data reception center and initiate transmission of EKG data. Other devices use Internet-based in-home computers to capture and store EKG data. When such devices detect pre-programmed arrhythmias, data is automatically sent via modem and standard telephone lines to a central receiving center, or independent diagnostic testing facility (IDTF), where the data is reviewed. Internet-based in-home computer systems may also provide the receiving center with a daily computer-generated report that summarizes 24 hours of EKG data.</p>

<p>Certain cardiac event monitors capture electrical activity with a single electrode attached to the skin. Other devices may employ multiple electrodes in order to record more complex EKG tracings. Additionally, devices may be individually programmed to detect patient-specific factors, electrode malfunction, or other factors. Cardiac event monitors can be further categorized as either “pre-event” or “post-event” recorders, based on their memory capabilities:</p>

<ol start=""1"" type=""a"">
<li><p>Pre-symptom Memory Loop Recorder (MLR)</p>

<p>Upon detecting symptoms, the wearer presses a button, which activates the recorder to save (i.e., memorize) an interval of pre-symptom EKG data along with data during and subsequent to the symptomatic event. Self-sensing recorders (also known as event-activated or automatic trigger) do not require patient input to capture these data. Single or multiple events may be recorded. The device is worn at all times, usually for up to 30 days.</p>

<ul type=""circle"">
<li>Implantable (or Insertable Loop) Recorder (ILR)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another type of pre-symptom MLR, it is implanted subcutaneously in a patient’s upper left chest and may remain implanted for many months. An ILR is used when syncope is thought to be cardiac-related, but is too infrequent to be detected by either a Holter&#8482; monitor or a traditional pre-symptom MLR.</p></li>

<li><p>Post-symptom Recorder</p>

<p>The patient temporarily places this device against the chest when symptoms occur and activates it by pressing a button. These recorders represent old technology, as they do not include a memory loop. The device transmits EKG data telephonically in real-time and is usually used for up to 30 days.</p>

Coverage of future testing in these patients depends on their serologic status and on whether they have been successfully immunized against hepatitis B virus. The following table summarizes the frequency of serologic surveillance for hepatitis B. Tests furnished according to this table do not require additional documentation and are paid separately because payment for maintenance dialysis treatments does not take them into account.</p>

<p>Patients who are in the process of receiving hepatitis B vaccines, but have not received the complete series, should continue to be routinely screened as susceptible. Between one and six months after the third dose, all vaccines should be tested for anti-HBs to confirm their response to the vaccine. Patients who have a level of anti-HBs of at least 10 sample ratio units (SRUs) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or who are positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are considered adequate responders to vaccine and need only be tested for anti-HBs annually to verify their immune status. If anti-HBs drops below 10 SRUs by RIA or is negative by EIA, a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given.</p>

This section is designed as a quick reference tool for determining the coverage status of certain pieces of DME and especially for those items commonly referred to by both brand and generic names. The information contained herein is applicable (where appropriate) to all DME national coverage determinations (NCDs) discussed in the DME portion of this manual. The list is organized into two columns. The first column lists alphabetically various generic categories of equipment on which NCDs have been made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); the second column notes the coverage status.</p>
	
<p>In the case of equipment categories that have been determined by CMS to be covered under the DME benefit, the list outlines the conditions of coverage that must be met if payment is to be allowed for the rental or purchase of the DME by a particular patient, or cross-refers to another section of the manual where the applicable coverage criteria are described in more detail. With respect to equipment categories that cannot be covered as DME, the list includes a brief
explanation of why the equipment is not covered. This DME list will be updated periodically to 	reflect any additional NCDs that CMS may make with regard to other categories of equipment.</p>
	
<p>When the A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC receives a claim for an item of equipment which does not appear to fall logically into any of the generic categories listed or has not been addressed in the processes outlined in regulations at 42 CFR §§414.114 and 414.240, the A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC has the authority and responsibility for deciding whether those items are covered under the DME benefit.</p>
	
<p>These decisions must be made by each A/B MAC (HHH) and DME MAC based on the advice of its medical consultants, taking into account:</p>
<ul><li>The Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 20, “Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics and Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS).”</li>
<li>Whether the item has been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is otherwise generally considered to be safe and effective for the purpose intended; and</li>
<li>Whether the item is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient.</li></ul>
	
<p>The term DME is defined as equipment which, according to 42 CFR §414.202:</p>

<ul><li>Can withstand repeated use; i.e., could normally be rented and used by successive patients;</li>
<li>Effective with respect to items classified as DME after January 1, 2012, has an expected life of at least 3 years;</li>
<li>Is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose;</li>
<li>Generally, is not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; and,</li>
<li>Is appropriate for use in a patient’s home.</li></ul>","<p align=""center""> <strong> Durable Medical Equipment Reference List</strong></p>

193,1,True,2,"230.7","Water Purification and Softening Systems Used in Conjunction with Home Dialysis",1989-05-01 00:00:00,,,"","<strong><p>  A.  Water Purification Systems</p></strong>

<p>  Water used for home dialysis should be chemically free of heavy trace metals and/or organic contaminants which could be hazardous to the patient. It should also be as free of bacteria as possible but need not be biologically sterile. Since the characteristics of natural water supplies in most areas of the country are such that some type of water purification system is needed, such a system used in conjunction with a home dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) unit is covered under Medicare.</p>

<p>  There are two types of water purification systems which will satisfy these requirements:</p>

<ul>  
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Deionization - The removal of organic substances, mineral salts of magnesium and calcium (causing hardness), compounds of fluoride and chloride from tap water using the process of filtration and ion exchange; or</li>

<li>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse Osmosis (RO) - The process used to remove impurities from tap water utilizing pressure to force water through a porous membrane.</li>
</ul>

<p>  Use of both a deionization unit and RO unit in series, theoretically to provide the advantages of both systems, has been determined medically unnecessary since either system can provide water which is both chemically and bacteriologically pure enough for acceptable use in home dialysis. In addition, spare deionization tanks are not covered since they are essentially a precautionary supply rather than a current requirement for treatment of the patient.</p>

<p>  Activated carbon filters used as a component of water purification systems to remove unsafe concentrations of chlorine and chloramines are covered when prescribed by a physician.</p>

<strong><p>  B.  Water Softening System</p></strong>

<p>  Except as indicated below, a water softening system used in conjunction with home dialysis is excluded from coverage under Medicare as not being reasonable and necessary within the meaning of &sect;1862(a)(1) of the Social Security Act. Such a system, in conjunction with a home dialysis unit, does not adequately remove the hazardous heavy metal contaminants (such as arsenic) which may be present in trace amounts.</p>

<p>  A water softening system may be covered when used to pretreat water to be purified by a RO unit for home dialysis where:</p>

<p>The manufacturer of the RO unit has set standards for the quality of water entering the RO (e.g., the water to be purified by the RO must be of a certain quality if the unit is to perform as intended);</p>

<p>The patient's water is demonstrated to be of a lesser quality than required; and,</p>

<p>  The softener is used only to soften water entering the RO unit, and thus, used only for dialysis. (The softener need not actually be built into the RO unit, but must be an integral part of the dialysis system.)</p>

<strong><p>  C.  Developing Need When a Water Softening System is Replaced with a Water Purification Unit in an Existing Home Dialysis System</p></strong>

<p>  The medical necessity of water purification units must be carefully developed when they replace water softening systems in existing home dialysis systems. A purification system may be ordered under these circumstances for a number of reasons. For example, changes in the medical community's opinions regarding the quality of water necessary for safe dialysis may lead the physician to decide the quality of water previously used should be improved, or the water quality itself may have deteriorated. Patients may have dialyzed using only an existing water softener previous to Medicare end-state renal disease coverage because of inability to pay for a purification system. On the other hand, in some cases, the installation of a purification system is not medically necessary. Thus, when such a case comes to the Medicare Administrative Contractor's (MAC's) attention, the MAC asks the physician to furnish the reason for the changes. Supporting documentation, such as the supplier's recommendations or water analysis, may be required. All such cases should be reviewed by the MAC's medical consultants.</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 15, ""Covered Medical and Other Health Services,"" &sect;110.</p>","","36",1989-05-01 00:00:00,"","",25,"<p>  05/1989 - Re-categorized dialysis equipment from DME to Home Dialysis Supplies and Equipment for coverage purposes.

This is because the purpose of the examination is not for the care of the teeth or structures directly supporting the teeth.

<p>     This procedure involves inserting a balloon catheter into a narrow or occluded blood vessel to recanalize and dilate the vessel by inflating the balloon. The objective of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is to improve the blood flow through the diseased segment of a vessel so that vessel patency is increased and embolization is decreased. With the development and use of balloon angioplasty for treatment of atherosclerotic and other vascular stenoses, PTA (with and without the placement of a stent) is a widely used technique for dilating lesions of peripheral, renal, and coronary arteries.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>The PTA is covered when used under the following conditions:</p>

<p><strong>1. Treatment of Atherosclerotic Obstructive Lesions</strong></p>

<p>-In the lower extremities, i.e., the iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries, or in the upper extremities, i.e., the innominate, subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries. The upper extremities do not include head or neck vessels.</p>
	
<p>-Of a single coronary artery for patients for whom the likely alternative treatment is coronary bypass surgery and who exhibit the following characteristics:</p>
	
<ul><li>Angina refractory to optimal medical management;</li>
<li>Objective evidence of myocardial ischemia; and</li>
<li>Lesions amenable to angioplasty</li></ul>
	
<p>-Of the renal arteries for patients in whom there is an inadequate response to a thorough medical management of symptoms and for whom surgery is the likely alternative. PTA for this group of patients is an alternative to surgery, not simply an addition to medical management.</p>
<p>-Of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas and grafts when performed through either a venous or arterial approach.</p>
	
<p><strong>2. Concurrent with Carotid Stent Placement in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-Approved Category B Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2001, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery concurrent with carotid stent placement when furnished in accordance with the FDA-approved protocols governing Category B IDE clinical trials. PTA of the carotid artery, when provided solely for the purpose of carotid artery dilation concurrent with carotid stent placement, is considered to be a reasonable and necessary service when provided in the context of such a clinical trial.</p>
	
<p><strong>3. Concurrent with Carotid Stent Placement in FDA-Approved Post-Approval Studies</strong></p>

<p>Effective October 12, 2004, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery concurrent with the placement of an FDA-approved carotid stent and an FDA-approved or –cleared embolic protection device (effective December 9, 2009) for an FDA-approved indication when furnished in accordance with FDA-approved protocols governing post-approval studies. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) determines that coverage of PTA of the carotid artery is reasonable and necessary in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>4. Concurrent with Carotid Stent Placement</strong></p>

<p>Effective October 11, 2023, CMS covers PTA of the carotid artery concurrent with stenting with the placement of an FDA-approved carotid stent with an FDA-approved or cleared embolic protection device, for Medicare beneficiaries under the following conditions:</p>
	
<p>A. Patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis &ge;50%; and,<br>
	B. Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis &ge;70%.</em></p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both A and B above:</p>
	
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Neurological assessment by a neurologist or NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) certified health professional before and after CAS must be performed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. First-line evaluation of carotid artery stenosis must use duplex ultrasound.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography, if not contraindicated, must be used to confirm the degree of stenosis and provide additional information about the aortic arch, and extra- and intra-cranial circulation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Intra-arterial digital subtraction (catheter) angiography may be used only when there is significant
discrepancy between non-invasive imaging results, or in lieu of computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography if these are contraindicated.</p>
	
<p>Prior to furnishing CAS, the practitioner must engage in a formal shared decision-making interaction with the beneficiary. The shared decision-making interaction must include:</p>
	
<ul><li> Discussion of all treatment options including carotid endarterectomy (CEA), CAS (which includes transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), and optimal medical therapy (OMT)).</li>
<li>Explanation of risks and benefits for each option specific to the beneficiary’s clinical situation.</li>
<li>Integration of clinical guidelines (e.g., patient comorbidities and concomitant treatments).</li>
<li>Discussion and incorporation of beneficiary’s personal preferences and priorities in choosing a treatment plan.</li></ul>
	
<p>Facilities must establish and maintain institutional and physician standards to support a dedicated carotid stent program. These standards must at least include and ensure the following:</p>
	
<ul><li>Facilities have a clearly delineated program for granting carotid stent privileges and for monitoring patient outcomes for individual physicians and the program as a whole.</li>
<li>The oversight committee for this program shall be empowered to identify the minimum case volume for a physician to maintain privileges, as well as the (risk-adjusted) threshold for complications that the institution will allow before suspending privileges or instituting measures for remediation. Committees are encouraged to apply published standards from specialty societies and widely-used, published professional society guidelines to determine appropriate physician qualifications.</li>
<li>Facilities have appropriately trained staff capable of fulfilling roles and responsibilities as delineated under the dedicated carotid stent program.</li>
<li>Facilities have appropriate supporting personnel and equipment for imaging, emergency management, advanced physiologic monitoring, and other ancillary care.</li>
<li>Facilities must ensure continuous quality improvement by assessing procedural outcomes and making necessary programmatic adjustments to assure patient safety.</li></ul>
	
<p><strong>5. Concurrent with Intracranial Stent Placement in FDA-Approved Category B IDE Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>Effective November 6, 2006, Medicare covers PTA and stenting of intracranial arteries for the treatment of cerebral artery stenosis &ge;50% in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease when furnished in accordance with the FDA-approved protocols governing Category B IDE clinical trials. CMS determines that coverage of intracranial PTA and stenting is reasonable and necessary under these circumstances.</p>
	
<p><strong>C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>
<p>All other indications for PTA with or without stenting to treat obstructive lesions of the vertebral and cerebral arteries remain non-covered.</p>
<p>All other indications for PTA without stenting for which CMS has not specifically indicated coverage remain non-covered.</p>
	
<p><strong>D. Other</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the national coverage described above, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may make reasonable and necessary determinations under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act for any other beneficiary seeking coverage for PTA of the carotid artery concurrent with stenting.</p>

There are organizations which encourage and train blind diabetics, both to fill their own syringes and to inject themselves. There are also a number of devices available for blind individuals to fill their syringes accurately. However, the individuals who may need assistance with prefilling their syringes may also require periodic observation and evaluation, even though their diabetes is fairly stabilized. In such cases, probably few in number, home health services may be required for this purpose.</p>","<p>To qualify for home health benefits, a blind diabetic must be confined to his home, under the care of a physician, and in need of either skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speech  -language pathology services.  Effective July 1, 1981, a person may qualify for home health benefits based on his or her need for skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis, physical therapy, speech  -language pathology, or occupational therapy. Effective December 1, 1981, occupational therapy is eliminated as a basis for entitlement to home health services. However, if a person has otherwise qualified for home health services because of the need for skilled nursing care, physical therapy or speech  -language pathology, the patient's eligibility for home health services may be extended solely on the basis of the continuing need for occupational therapy. (See the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 7, ""Home Health Services,"" &#167;20.) There must be a plan of treatment, established and periodically reviewed by a physician, which indicates that there is a recurring need for home health services to supplement the physician's contacts with the patient; e.g., skilled nursing visits for observing and determining the need for changes in the level and type of care which has been prescribed. (See the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 7, ""Home Health Services,"" &#167;30.) Once an initial regimen has been established, the frequency of need for further home health services can vary greatly from patient to patient, depending on their condition and the likelihood of its changing. Some may need visits only every 90 days, for example, while others may require them much more frequently. If a nurse makes a visit to provide skilled services, and also prefills syringes, the purpose of the visit, which was to provide skilled services, does not change. However, if the sole purpose of the nurse's visit is to prefill insulin syringes for a blind diabetic, it is not a skilled nursing visit although it may be reimbursed as such as indicated below.</p>

<p>Filling a syringe can be safely and effectively performed by the average nonmedical person without the direct supervision of a licensed nurse. Consequently, it would not constitute a skilled nursing service even if it is performed by a nurse. (See the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 7, ""Home Health Services,"" &#167;30.2.2.) The personal care duties normally performed by home health aides include assisting the patient with medications ordered by a physician which are ordinarily self-administered. (See the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 7, ""Home Health Services,"" &#167;50.2.) </p>

<p>Performance of such a service by an aide is consistent with the Medicare conditions of participation for home health agencies. Therefore, home health aide services would be appropriate for those blind diabetics who are qualified for home health benefits and who cannot fill their syringes. An adequately trained home health aide could make intermittent visits, usually on a weekly basis, to the home for the purpose of filling that supply of insulin ordered by the physician.</p>

<p>If State law, however, precludes a home health aide from prefilling insulin syringes, payment may be made for this service as part of the cost of skilled nursing services when performed by a nurse for a blind diabetic who is otherwise unable to prefill his or her syringes. There are no adverse consequences with respect to reimbursement to the home health agency for providing the service in this manner.</p>

<p>If State law does not preclude a home health aide from prefilling insulin syringes, but the home health agency chooses to send a nurse to perform only this task, the visit is reimbursed as if made by a home health aide.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As indicated, to qualify for home health benefits, a patient must require skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speech  -language pathology.

<p>Wound healing is a dynamic, interactive process that involves multiple cells and proteins. There are three progressive stages of normal wound healing, and the typical wound healing duration is about 4 weeks. While cutaneous wounds are a disruption of the normal, anatomic structure and function of the skin, subcutaneous wounds involve tissue below the skin's surface. Wounds are categorized as either acute, where the normal wound healing stages are not yet completed but it is presumed they will be, resulting in orderly and timely wound repair, or chronic, where a wound has failed to progress through the normal wound healing stages and repair itself within a sufficient time period.</p>
	
	
<p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is produced in an autologous or homologous manner. Autologous PRP is comprised of blood from the patient who will ultimately receive the PRP. Alternatively, homologous PRP is derived from blood from multiple donors.</p>
	
<p>Blood is donated by the patient and centrifuged to produce an autologous gel for treatment of chronic, nonhealing cutaneous wounds that persist for 30 days or longer and fail to properly complete the healing process. Autologous blood derived products for chronic, non-healing wounds includes both: (1) platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) products, and (2) PRP (such as AutoloGel).</p>
	
<p>The PRP is different from previous products in that it contains whole cells including white cells, red cells, plasma, platelets, fibrin, stem cells, and fibrocyte precursors.</p>
	
<p>The PRP is used by physicians in clinical settings in treating chronic, non-healing wounds, open, cutaneous wounds, soft tissue and bone.

<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) addresses numerous items that it terms &#8220;mobility assistive equipment&#8221; (MAE) and includes within that category canes, crutches, walkers, manual wheelchairs, power wheelchairs, and scooters. This list, however, is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>Medicare beneficiaries may require mobility assistance for a variety of reasons and for varying durations because the etiology of the disability may be due to a congenital cause, injury, or disease. Thus, some beneficiaries experiencing temporary disability may need mobility assistance on a short-term basis, while in contrast, those living with chronic conditions or enduring disabilities will require mobility assistance on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>Medicare beneficiaries who depend upon mobility assistance are found in varied living situations. Some may live alone and independently while others may live with a caregiver or in a custodial care facility. The beneficiary's environment is relevant to the determination of the appropriate form of mobility assistance that should be employed. For many patients, a device of some sort is compensation for the mobility deficit. Many beneficiaries experience co-morbid conditions that can impact their ability to safely utilize MAE independently or to successfully regain independent function even with mobility assistance.</p>

<p>The functional limitation as experienced by a beneficiary depends on the beneficiary's physical and psychological function, the availability of other support, and the beneficiary's living environment. A few examples include muscular spasticity, cognitive deficits, the availability of a caregiver, and the physical layout, surfaces, and obstacles that exist in the beneficiary's living environment.</p>","<p>  <strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>Effective May 5, 2005, CMS finds that the evidence is adequate to determine that MAE is reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries who have a personal mobility deficit sufficient to impair their participation in mobility-related activities of daily living (MRADLs) such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and bathing in customary locations within the home. Determination of the presence of a mobility deficit will be made by an algorithmic process, Clinical Criteria for MAE Coverage, to provide the appropriate MAE to correct the mobility deficit.</p>

<p>Clinical Criteria for MAE Coverage</p>

<p>The beneficiary, the beneficiary&#8217;s family or other caregiver, or a clinician, will usually initiate the discussion and consideration of MAE use. Sequential consideration of the questions below provides clinical guidance for the coverage of equipment of appropriate type and complexity to restore the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to participate in MRADLs such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and bathing in customary locations in the home. These questions correspond to the numbered decision points on the accompanying flow chart. In individual cases where the beneficiary&#8217;s condition clearly and unambiguously precludes the reasonable use of a device, it is not necessary to undertake a trial of that device for that beneficiary.</p>

<ol>  
<li>Does the beneficiary have a mobility limitation that significantly impairs his/her ability to participate in one or more MRADLs in the home? A mobility limitation is one that:<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>    Prevents the beneficiary from accomplishing the MRADLs entirely, or,</li>

<li>Places the beneficiary at reasonably determined heightened risk of morbidity or mortality secondary to the attempts to participate in MRADLs, or,</li>

<li>Prevents the beneficiary from completing the MRADLs within a reasonable time frame.</li>
</ol>
<br></li>

<li>Are there other conditions that limit the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to participate in MRADLs at home?<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>Some examples are significant impairment of cognition or judgment and/or vision.</li>

<li>For these beneficiaries, the provision of MAE might not enable them to participate in MRADLs if the comorbidity prevents effective use of the wheelchair or reasonable completion of the tasks even with MAE.</li>
</ol>

<br></li>

<li>If these other limitations exist, can they be ameliorated or compensated sufficiently such that the additional provision of MAE will be reasonably expected to significantly improve the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to perform or obtain assistance to participate in MRADLs in the home?<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>A caregiver, for example a family member, may be compensatory, if consistently available in the beneficiary's home and willing and able to safely operate and transfer the beneficiary to and from the wheelchair and to transport the beneficiary using the wheelchair. The caregiver&#8217;s need to use a wheelchair to assist the beneficiary in the MRADLs is to be considered in this determination.</li>

<li>If the amelioration or compensation requires the beneficiary's compliance with treatment, for example medications or therapy, substantive non-compliance, whether willing or involuntary, can be grounds for denial of MAE coverage if it results in the beneficiary continuing to have a significant limitation. It may be determined that partial compliance results in adequate amelioration or compensation for the appropriate use of MAE.</li>
</ol>
<br>
</li>

<li>Does the beneficiary or caregiver demonstrate the capability and the willingness to consistently operate the MAE safely?<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>Safety considerations include personal risk to the beneficiary as well as risk to others. The determination of safety may need to occur several times during the process as the consideration focuses on a specific device.</li>

<li>A history of unsafe behavior in other venues may be considered.</li>
</ol>

<br></li>

<li>Can the functional mobility deficit be sufficiently resolved by the prescription of a cane or walker?<br>
<br> 

<ol type=""a"">  
<li>The cane or walker should be appropriately fitted to the beneficiary for this evaluation.</li>

<li>Assess the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to safely use a cane or walker.</li>
</ol><br></li>

<li>Does the beneficiary&#8217;s typical environment support the use of wheelchairs including scooters/power-operated vehicles (POVs)?<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>Determine whether the beneficiary&#8217;s environment will support the use of these types of MAE.</li>

<li>Keep in mind such factors as physical layout, surfaces, and obstacles, which may render MAE unusable in the beneficiary&#8217;s home.</li>
</ol>
<br>
</li>

<li>Does the beneficiary have sufficient upper extremity function to propel a manual wheelchair in the home to participate in MRADLs during a typical day? The manual wheelchair should be optimally configured (seating options, wheelbase, device weight, and other appropriate accessories) for this determination.<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>Limitations of strength, endurance, range of motion, coordination, and absence or deformity in one or both upper extremities are relevant.</li>

<li>A beneficiary with sufficient upper extremity function may qualify for a manual wheelchair. The appropriate type of manual wheelchair, i.e. light weight, etc., should be determined based on the beneficiary&#8217;s physical characteristics and anticipated intensity of use.</li>

<li>The beneficiary's home should provide adequate access, maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a manual wheelchair.</li>

<li>Assess the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to safely use a manual wheelchair.<br></li>
<br></ol>
<strong>  NOTE:</strong> If the beneficiary is unable to self-propel a manual wheelchair, and if there is a caregiver who is available, willing, and able to provide assistance, a manual wheelchair may be appropriate.

<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Does the beneficiary have sufficient strength and postural stability to operate a POV/scooter?<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>A POV is a 3- or 4-wheeled device with tiller steering and limited seat modification capabilities. The beneficiary must be able to maintain stability and position for adequate operation.</li>

<li>The beneficiary's home should provide adequate access, maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a POV.</li>

<li>Assess the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to safely use a POV/scooter.</li>
</ol><br></li>

<li>Are the additional features provided by a power wheelchair needed to allow the beneficiary to participate in one or more MRADLs?<br>
<br>
 
<ol type=""a"">  
<li>The pertinent features of a power wheelchair compared to a POV are typically control by a joystick or alternative input device, lower seat height for slide transfers, and the ability to accommodate a variety of seating needs.</li>

<li>The type of wheelchair and options provided should be appropriate for the degree of the beneficiary&#8217;s functional impairments.</li>

<li>The beneficiary's home should provide adequate access, maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a power wheelchair.</li>

<li>Assess the beneficiary&#8217;s ability to safely use a power wheelchair.<br></li>
<br></ol>
<strong>  NOTE:</strong> If the beneficiary is unable to use a power wheelchair, and if there is a caregiver who is available, willing, and able to provide assistance, a manual wheelchair is appropriate. A caregiver&#8217;s inability to operate a manual wheelchair can be considered in covering a power wheelchair so that the caregiver can assist the beneficiary.

Home blood glucose monitors enable certain patients to better control their blood glucose levels by frequently checking and appropriately contacting their attending physician for advice and treatment. Studies indicate that the patient&#8217;s ability to carefully follow proper procedures is critical to obtaining satisfactory results with these devices. In addition, the cost of the devices, with their supplies, limits economical use to patients who must make frequent checks of their blood glucose levels. Accordingly, coverage of home blood glucose monitors is limited to patients meeting the following conditions:</p>

<ol>  
<li>  The patient has been diagnosed as having diabetes;</li>

<li>  The patient&#8217;s physician states that the patient is capable of being trained to use the particular device prescribed in an appropriate manner. In some cases, the patient may not be able to perform this function, but a responsible individual can be trained to use the equipment and monitor the patient to assure that the intended effect is achieved. This is permissible if the record is properly documented by the patient&#8217;s physician; and</li>

<li>  The device is designed for home rather than clinical use.</li>
</ol>

<p>  There is also a blood glucose monitoring system designed especially for use by those with visual impairments. The monitors used in such systems are identical in terms of reliability and sensitivity to the standard blood glucose monitors described above. They differ by having such features as voice synthesizers, automatic timers, and specially designed arrangements of supplies and materials to enable the visually impaired to use the equipment without assistance.</p>

<p>  These special blood glucose monitoring systems are covered under Medicare if the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>  
<li>  The patient and device meet the three conditions listed above for coverage of standard home blood glucose monitors; and</li>

<li>  The patient's physician certifies that he or she has a visual impairment severe enough to require use of this special monitoring system.</li>
</ul>

<p>  The additional features and equipment of these special systems justify a higher reimbursement amount than allowed for standard blood glucose monitors. Separately identify claims for such devices and establish a separate reimbursement amount for them.</p>","","","48",2006-03-17 00:00:00,"https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/Downloads/R48NCD.pdf","4278",25,"<p>  03/2006 - Technical Corrections to the NCD Manual.

<strong> <p>General CSII Criteria</p></strong>

<p>In addition to meeting Criterion A or B above, the following general requirements must be met:</p>

<p>The patient with diabetes must be insulinopenic per the updated fasting C-peptide testing requirement, or, as an alternative, must be beta cell autoantibody positive.</p>

<p>Updated fasting C-peptide testing requirement:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Insulinopenia is defined as a fasting C-peptide level that is less than or equal to 110% of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory's measurement method.</li>

<li> For patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance (actual or calculated from age, gender, weight, and serum creatinine) &le; 50 ml/minute, insulinopenia is defined as a fasting C-peptide level that is less than or equal to 200% of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory's measurement method.</li>

<li> Fasting C-peptide levels will only be considered valid with a concurrently obtained fasting glucose &le; 225 mg/dL.</li>

<li> Levels only need to be documented once in the medical records.</li>
</ul>

<p>Continued coverage of the insulin pump would require that the patient be seen and evaluated by the treating physician at least every 3 months.</p>

<p>The pump must be ordered by and follow-up care of the patient must be managed by a physician who manages multiple patients with CSII and who works closely with a team including nurses, diabetes educators, and dietitians who are knowledgeable in the use of CSII.</p>

<strong> <p>Other Uses of CSII</p></strong>

<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue to allow coverage of all other uses of CSII in accordance with the Category B investigational device exemption clinical trials regulation (42 CFR 405.201) or as a routine cost under the clinical trials policy (Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=1&ncdver=2&DocID=310.1&kq=true&SearchType=Advanced&bc=EAAAAAgAAAAA&"">310.1</a>).</p>

<strong><p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Uses</p></strong>

<p>Other uses of external infusion pumps are covered if the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) medical staff verifies the appropriateness of the therapy and the prescribed pump for the individual patient.</p> 

<p><strong> NOTE:</strong> Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of a covered external infusion pump as long as the drug being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment.</p>

<div style=""margin-left: 1cm;""><strong><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer (Effective for Services Performed On or After September 26, 1984)</p></strong>

<p>The implantable infusion pump is covered for intra-arterial infusion of 5-FUdR for the treatment of liver cancer for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma or Duke's Class D colorectal cancer, in whom the metastases are limited to the liver, and where: (1) the disease is unresectable, or, (2) the patient refuses surgical excision of the tumor.</p>

<strong><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-Spasmodic Drugs for Severe Spasticity</p></strong>

<p>An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer anti-spasmodic drugs intrathecally (e.g., baclofen) to treat chronic intractable spasticity in patients who have proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria:</p>

<p>As indicated by at least a 6-week trial, the patient cannot be maintained on non-invasive methods of spasm control, such as oral anti-spasmodic drugs, either because these methods fail to control adequately the spasticity or produce intolerable side effects.  And prior to pump implantation, the patient must have responded favorably to a trial intrathecal dose of the anti-spasmodic drug.</p>

<strong><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opioid Drugs for Treatment of Chronic Intractable Pain</p></strong>

<p>An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer opioid drugs (e.g., morphine) intrathecally or epidurally for treatment of severe chronic intractable pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin in patients who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and who have proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria:</p>

<p>The patient's history must indicate that he/she would not respond adequately to noninvasive methods of pain control, such as systemic opioids (including attempts to eliminate physical and behavioral abnormalities which may cause an exaggerated reaction to pain); and a preliminary trial of intraspinal opioid drug administration must be undertaken with a temporary intrathecal/epidural catheter to substantiate adequately acceptable pain relief and degree of side effects (including effects on the activities of daily living) and patient acceptance.</p>

<strong><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage of Other Uses of Implanted Infusion Pumps</p></strong>

<p>Determinations may be made on coverage of other uses of implanted infusion pumps if the MAC medical staff verifies that:</p>

<ul> 
<li> The drug is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the individual patient;</li>

<li> It is medically necessary that the drug be administered by an implanted infusion pump; and,</li>

<li> The Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling for the pump must specify that the drug being administered and the purpose for which it is administered is an indicated use for the pump.</li>
</ul>

<strong><p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implantation of Infusion Pump Is Contraindicated</p></strong>

<p>The implantation of an infusion pump is contraindicated in the following patients:</p>

<p>With a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug being used (e.g., oral baclofen, morphine, etc.);or,</p>

<p> Who have an active infection;or,</p>

<p> Whose body size is insufficient to support the weight and bulk of the device; or,</p>

<p> With other implanted programmable devices since crosstalk between devices may inadvertently change the prescription.</p>

<p><strong> NOTE:</strong> Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of an implantable infusion pump as long as the drug being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment.</p>
</div>

<p> <strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p> The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are not covered under Medicare:</p>

<strong><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Infusion Pumps</p></strong>

<strong><p>Vancomycin (Effective for Services Beginning On or After September 1, 1996)</p></strong>


<p>Medicare coverage of vancomycin as a durable medical equipment infusion pump benefit is not covered. There is insufficient evidence to support the necessity of using an external infusion pump, instead of a disposable elastomeric pump or the gravity drip method, to administer vancomycin in a safe and appropriate manner.</p>

The garment is intermittently inflated and deflated with cycle times and pressures that vary between devices.</p>","<p>    Pneumatic devices are covered for the treatment of lymphedema or for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency with venous stasis ulcers.</p>

<p><strong>Lymphedema</strong></p>

<p>    Lymphedema is the swelling of subcutaneous tissues due to the accumulation of excessive lymph fluid. The accumulation of lymph fluid results from impairment to the normal clearing function of the lymphatic system and/or from an excessive production of lymph. Lymphedema is divided into two broad classes according to etiology. Primary lymphedema is a relatively uncommon, chronic condition which may be due to such causes as Milroy's Disease or congenital anomalies. Secondary lymphedema, which is much more common, results from the destruction of or damage to formerly functioning lymphatic channels, such as surgical removal of lymph nodes or post radiation fibrosis, among other causes.</p>

<p>    Pneumatic compression devices are covered in the home setting for the treatment of lymphedema if the patient has undergone a four-week trial of conservative therapy and the treating physician determines that there has been no significant improvement or if significant symptoms remain after the trial. The trial of conservative therapy must include use of an appropriate compression bandage system or compression garment, exercise, and elevation of the limb. The garment may be prefabricated or custom-fabricated but must provide adequate graduated compression.</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Venous Insufficiency With Venous Stasis Ulcers</strong></p>

<p>    Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower extremities is a condition caused by abnormalities of the venous wall and valves, leading to obstruction or reflux of blood flow in the veins. Signs of CVI include hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, chronic edema, and venous ulcers.</p>

<p>    Pneumatic compression devices are covered in the home setting for the treatment of CVI of the lower extremities only if the patient has one or more venous stasis ulcer(s) which have failed to heal after a 6 month trial of conservative therapy directed by the treating physician. The trial of conservative therapy must include a compression bandage system or compression garment, appropriate dressings for the wound, exercise, and elevation of the limb.</p>

<p><strong>General Coverage Criteria</strong></p>

<p>    Pneumatic compression devices are covered only when prescribed by a physician and when they are used with appropriate physician oversight, i.e., physician evaluation of the patient's condition to determine medical necessity of the device, assuring suitable instruction in the operation of the machine, a treatment plan defining the pressure to be used and the frequency and duration of use, and ongoing monitoring of use and response to treatment.</p>

<p>    The determination by the physician of the medical necessity of a pneumatic compression device must include:</p>

<ol>    
<li>    The patient's diagnosis and prognosis;</li>

<li>    Symptoms and objective findings, including measurements which establish the severity of the condition;</li>

<li>    The reason the device is required, including the treatments which have been tried and failed; and</li>

<li>    The clinical response to an initial treatment with the device. </li>
</ol>


<p>The clinical response includes the change in pre-treatment measurements, ability to tolerate the treatment session and parameters, and ability of the patient (or caregiver) to apply the device for continued use in the home.</p>

<p>    The only time that a segmented, calibrated gradient pneumatic compression device (HCPCs code E0652) would be covered is when the individual has unique characteristics that prevent them from receiving satisfactory pneumatic compression treatment using a nonsegmented device in conjunction with a segmented appliance or a segmented compression device without manual control of pressure in each chamber.</p>","See the NCD on Durable Medical Equipment Reference List, §<a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=190&ncdver=2"">280.1</a>.","","151",2002-01-14 00:00:00,"https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/Downloads/R151CIM.pdf","1944",25,"<p>  01/2002 - Clarified language previously found in&#160;TN 148 so that it is clear when segmented, calibrated gradient pneumatic compression devices will be covered.

<p>         Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive technique for providing single levels of air pressure from a flow generator, via a nose mask, through the nares. The purpose is to prevent the collapse of the oropharyngeal walls and the obstruction of airflow during sleep, which occurs in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</p> 
 
<p>     The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is equal to the average number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) is equal to the average number of respiratory disturbances per hour.</p> 
 
<p>     Apnea is defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds. Hypopnea is defined as an abnormal respiratory event lasting at least 10 seconds with at least a 30% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement or airflow as compared to baseline, and with at least a 4% oxygen desaturation.</p> 
 
<p>     The AHI and/or RDI may be measured by polysomnography (PSG) in a facility-based sleep study laboratory, or by a Type II home sleep test (HST) monitor, a Type III HST monitor, or a Type IV HST monitor measuring at least 3 channels.</p>","<p><strong>B.&#160;&#160;&#160;Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p> 
 
<p>Effective for claims with dates of service on and after March 13, 2008, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) determines that CPAP therapy when used in adult patients with OSA is considered reasonable and necessary under the following situations:</p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>The use of CPAP is covered under Medicare when used in adult patients with OSA. Coverage of CPAP is initially limited to a 12-week period to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with OSA as subsequently described who benefit from CPAP. CPAP is subsequently covered only for those beneficiaries diagnosed with OSA who benefit from CPAP during this 12-week period.</li><br>
<li>The provider of CPAP must conduct education of the beneficiary prior to the use of the CPAP device to ensure that the beneficiary has been educated in the proper use of the device. A caregiver, for example a family member, may be compensatory, if consistently available in the beneficiary's home and willing and able to safely operate the CPAP device.</li><br>
<li>A positive diagnosis of OSA for the coverage of CPAP must include a clinical evaluation and a positive: 
 
<ol type=""a""> 
	<li>attended PSG performed in a sleep laboratory; or</li> 
	<li>unattended HST with a Type II home sleep monitoring device; or</li> 
	<li>unattended HST with a Type III home sleep monitoring device; or</li> 
	<li>unattended HST with a Type IV home sleep monitoring device that measures at least 3 channels.</li> 
</ol></li><br> 
 
<li> The sleep test must have been previously ordered by the beneficiary&#8217;s treating physician and furnished under appropriate physician supervision. </li><br>
 
<li> An initial 12-week period of CPAP is covered in adult patients with OSA if either of the following criterion using the AHI or RDI are met: 
           
<ol type=""a""> 
	<li>AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 15 events per hour, or</li> 
	<li>AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 5 events and less than or equal to 14 events per hour with documented symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders or insomnia, or documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke.</li> 
</ol> 
</li> 
<br> 
 
<li>The AHI or RDI is calculated on the average number of events of per hour. If the AHI or RDI is calculated based on less than 2 hours of continuous recorded sleep, the total number of recorded events to calculate the AHI or RDI during sleep testing must be at a minimum the number of events that would have been required in a 2-hour period. </li><br>
 
<li>Apnea is defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds. Hypopnea is defined as an abnormal respiratory event lasting at least 10 seconds with at least a 30% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement or airflow as compared to baseline, and with at least a 4% oxygen desaturation. </li><br>
 
<li>Coverage with Evidence Development (CED): Medicare provides the following limited coverage for CPAP in adult beneficiaries who do not qualify for CPAP coverage based on criteria 1-7 above. A clinical study seeking Medicare payment for CPAP provided to a beneficiary who is an enrolled subject in that study must address one or more of the following questions 
<ol type=""a""> 
<li>In Medicare-aged subjects with clinically identified risk factors for OSA, how does the diagnostic accuracy of a clinical trial of CPAP compare with PSG and Type II, III &amp; IV HST in identifying subjects with OSA who will respond to CPAP?</li> 
<li>In Medicare-aged subjects with clinically identified risk factors for OSA who have not undergone confirmatory testing with PSG or Type II, III &amp; IV HST, does CPAP cause clinically meaningful harm?</li> 
<li>The study must meet the following additional standards:</li> 
	<li>The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular intervention potentially improves the participants&#8217; health outcomes.</li> 
	<li>The research study is well-supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.</li> 
<li>The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies.</li> 
<li>The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study.</li>

<p> A physician's prescription and such additional documentation as the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) medical staff may consider necessary, including medical records and physicians' reports, must establish the medical necessity for a hospital bed due to one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul><li> The patient's condition requires positioning of the body; e.g., to alleviate pain, promote good body alignment, prevent contractures, avoid respiratory infections, in ways not feasible in an ordinary bed; or</li>

<li> The patient's condition requires special attachments that cannot be fixed and used on an ordinary bed.</li>
</ul>

<strong><p> B.  Physician's Prescription</p></strong>

<p> The physician's prescription, which must accompany the initial claim, and supplementing documentation when required, must establish that a hospital bed is medically necessary. If the stated reason for the need for a hospital bed is the patient's condition requires positioning, the prescription or other documentation must describe the medical condition, e.g., cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, quadriplegia or paraplegia, and also the severity and frequency of the symptoms of the condition that necessitates a hospital bed for positioning.</p>

<p> If the stated reason for requiring a hospital bed is the patient's condition requires special attachments, the prescription must describe the patient's condition and specify the attachments that require a hospital bed.</p>

<strong><p> C.  Variable Height Feature</p></strong>

<p> In well documented cases, the MAC medical staff may determine that a variable height feature of a hospital bed, approved for coverage under subsection A above, is medically necessary and, therefore, covered, for one of the following conditions:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Severe arthritis and other injuries to lower extremities; e.g., fractured hip. The condition requires the variable height feature to assist the patient to ambulate by enabling the patient to place his or her feet on the floor while sitting on the edge of the bed;</li>

<li> Severe cardiac conditions. For those cardiac patients who are able to leave bed, but who must avoid the strain of ""jumping"" up or down;</li>

<li> Spinal cord injuries, including quadriplegic and paraplegic patients, multiple limb amputee and stroke patients. For those patients who are able to transfer from bed to a wheelchair, with or without help; or</li>

<li> Other severely debilitating diseases and conditions, if the variable height feature is required to assist the patient to ambulate.</li>
</ul>

<strong><p> D.  Electric Powered Hospital Bed Adjustments</p></strong>

<p> Electric powered adjustments to lower and raise head and foot may be covered when the MAC medical staff determines that the patient's condition requires frequent change in body position and/or there may be an immediate need for a change in body position (i.e., no delay can be tolerated) and the patient can operate the controls and cause the adjustments. Exceptions may be made to this last requirement in cases of spinal cord injury and brain damaged patients.</p>

This course of treatment must have been at least one month in duration without progression toward wound healing. This month of prerequisite conservative treatment may include some period in an institution as long as there is documentation available to verify that the necessary conservative treatment has been rendered.</li> 
 
<li> Use of wet-to-dry dressings for wound debridement, begun during the period of conservative treatment and which continue beyond 30 days, will not preclude coverage of air-fluidized bed. Should additional debridement again become necessary, while a patient is using an air-fluidized bed (after the first 30-day course of conservative treatment) that will not cause the air-fluidized bed to become non-covered. In all instances documentation verifying the continued need for the bed must be available.</li>

<p> Conservative treatment must include:</p> 
 
<ul>  
<li> Frequent repositioning of the patient with particular attention to relief of pressure over bony prominences (usually every 2 hours);</li> 
 
<li> Use of a specialized support surface (Group II) designed to reduce pressure and shear forces on healing ulcers and to prevent new ulcer formation;</li> 
 
<li> Necessary treatment to resolve any wound infection;</li> 
 
<li> Optimization of nutrition status to promote wound healing;</li> 
 
<li> Debridement by any means (including wet to dry dressings-which does not require an occulsive covering) to remove devitalized tissue from the wound bed;</li> 
 
<li> Maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with appropriate moist dressings protected by an occlusive covering, while the wound heals.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p> Home use of the air-fluidized bed is not covered under any of the following circumstances:</p> 
 
<ul>  
<li> The patient has coexisting pulmonary disease (the lack of firm back support makes coughing ineffective and dry air inhalation thickens pulmonary secretions);</li> 
 
<li> The patient requires treatment with wet soaks or moist wound dressings that are not protected with an impervious covering such as plastic wrap or other occlusive material;</li> 
 
<li> The caregiver is unwilling or unable to provide the type of care required by the patient on an air-fluidized bed;</li> 
 
<li> Structural support is inadequate to support the weight of the air-fluidized bed system (it generally weighs 1600 pounds or more);</li> 
 
<li> Electrical system is insufficient for the anticipated increase in energy consumption; or</li> 
 
<li> Other known contraindications exist.</li>

<p>Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is a pulse generator, similar to a pacemaker, that is surgically implanted under the skin of the left chest and an electrical lead (wire) is connected from the generator to the left vagus nerve. Electrical signals are sent from the battery-powered generator to the vagus nerve via the lead. These signals are in turn sent to the brain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VNS for treatment of refractory epilepsy in 1997 and for resistant depression in 2005.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>
<p>Effective for services performed on or after July 1, 1999, VNS is reasonable and necessary for patients with medically refractory partial onset seizures for whom surgery is not recommended or for whom surgery has failed.</p>

<p>Effective for services performed on or after February 15, 2019, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will cover FDA-approved VNS devices for treatment resistant depression (TRD) through Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) when offered in a CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up duration of at least one year with the possibility of extending the study to a prospective longitudinal study when the CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial has completed enrollment, and there are positive interim findings.</p>

<p>Each study must be approved by CMS and as a fully-described, written part of its protocol, must address whether VNS improves health outcomes for TRD patients compared to a control group, by answering all of the following research questions below. The details of the prospective longitudinal study must be described in the original protocol for the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Response is defined as a &ge; 50% improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline, as measured by a guideline recommended depression scale assessment tool. Remission is defined as being below the threshold on a guideline recommended depression scale assessment tool. The following research questions must be addressed in a separate analysis for patients with bipolar and unipolar disease.</p>

<p>Research Questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What is the rate of response (defined as person months of response/total months of study participation)?</li>
	<li>What is the rate of remission (defined as person months of response/total months of study participation)?</li>
	<li>What is the time from treatment until response scores are first achieved?</li>
	<li>What is the time from treatment until remission scores are first achieved?</li>
	<li>What are the population distributions of the maximum months of response, both consecutive and overall, separately?</li>
	<li>What are the population distributions of the maximum months of remission, both consecutive and overall, separately?</li>
	<li>What are the patient variables associated with successful treatment of TRD with VNS?</li>
	<li>What are the observed harms?</li>
	<li>What are the changes in disability, quality of life, general psychiatric status, and suicidality?</li>
</ul>

<p>Patient Criteria:</p>
<p>The following criteria must be used to identify patients demonstrating TRD:</p>

<ul><li>The patient must be in a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode for &ge; two years or have had at least four episodes of MDD, including the current episode. In order to confirm the patient has MDD, accepted diagnostic criteria from the most current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorder (DSM) and a structured clinical assessment are to be used.</li>
<li>The patient’s depressive illness meets a minimum criterion of four prior failed treatments of adequate dose and duration as measured by a tool designed for this purpose.</li>
<li>The patient is experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE) as measured by a guideline recommended depression scale assessment tool on two visits, within a 45-day span prior to implantation of the VNS device.</li></ul>

<p>Patients must maintain a stable medication regimen for at least four weeks before device implantation.</p>

<p>If patients with bipolar disorder are included, the condition must be carefully characterized.</p>

<p>Patients must not have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Current or lifetime history of psychotic features in any MDE;</li>
	<li>Current or lifetime history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder;</li>
	<li>Current or lifetime history of any other psychotic disorder;</li>
	<li>Current or lifetime history of rapid cycling bipolar disorder;</li>
	<li>Current secondary diagnosis of delirium, dementia, amnesia, or other cognitive disorder;</li>
	<li>Current suicidal intent; or,</li>
	<li>Treatment with another investigational device or investigational drugs.</li>

<strong><p>A. Implanted Peripheral Nerve Stimulators</p></strong>

<p>Payment may be made under the prosthetic device benefit for implanted peripheral nerve stimulators. Use of this stimulator involves implantation of electrodes around a selected peripheral nerve. The stimulating electrode is connected by an insulated lead to a receiver unit which is implanted under the skin at a depth not greater than 1/2 inch.</p>

<p>Stimulation is induced by a generator connected to an antenna unit which is attached to the skin surface over the receiver unit. Implantation of electrodes requires surgery and usually necessitates an operating room.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Peripheral nerve stimulators may also be employed to assess a patient’s suitability for continued treatment with an electric nerve stimulator. As explained in &sect;160.7.1, such use of the stimulator is covered as part of the total diagnostic service furnished to the beneficiary rather than as a prosthesis.</p>

<strong><p>B. Central Nervous System Stimulators (Dorsal Column and Depth Brain Stimulators)</p></strong>

<p>The implantation of central nervous system stimulators may be covered as therapies for the relief of chronic intractable pain, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<strong><p>1. Types of Implantations</p></strong>

<p>There are two types of implantations covered by this instruction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dorsal Column (Spinal Cord) Neurostimulation - The surgical implantation of neurostimulator electrodes within the dura mater (endodural) or the percutaneous insertion of electrodes in the epidural space is covered.</li>
<li>Depth Brain Neurostimulation - The stereotactic implantation of electrodes in the deep brain (e.g., thalamus and periaqueductal gray matter) is covered.</li>
</ul>

<strong><p>2. Conditions for Coverage</p></strong>

<p>No payment may be made for the implantation of dorsal column or depth brain stimulators or services and supplies related to such implantation, unless all of the conditions listed below have been met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The implantation of the stimulator is used only as a late resort (if not a last resort) for patients with chronic intractable pain;</li>
<li>With respect to item a, other treatment modalities (pharmacological, surgical, physical, or psychological therapies) have been tried and did not prove satisfactory, or are judged to be unsuitable or contraindicated for the given patient;</li>
<li>Patients have undergone careful screening, evaluation and diagnosis by a multidisciplinary team prior to implantation. (Such screening must include psychological, as well as physical evaluation);</li>
<li>All the facilities, equipment, and professional and support personnel required for the proper diagnosis, treatment training, and follow up of the patient (including that required to satisfy item c) must be available; and</li>
<li>Demonstration of pain relief with a temporarily implanted electrode precedes permanent implantation.</li>

<p> Mechanical/hydraulic incontinence control devices are accepted as safe and effective in the management of urinary incontinence in patients with permanent anatomic and neurologic dysfunctions of the bladder. This class of devices achieves control of urination by compression of the urethra. The materials used and the success rate may vary somewhat from device to device. Such a device is covered when its use is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient.</p>

<strong><p>B. Collagen Implant</p></strong>

<p> A collagen implant, which is injected into the submucosal tissues of the urethra and/or the bladder neck and into tissues adjacent to the urethra, is a prosthetic device used in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence resulting from intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). ISD is a cause of stress urinary incontinence in which the urethral sphincter is unable to contract and generate sufficient resistance in the bladder, especially during stress maneuvers.</p>

<p> Prior to collagen implant therapy, a skin test for collagen sensitivity must be administered and evaluated over a 4 week period.</p>

<p> In male patients, the evaluation must include a complete history and physical examination and a simple cystometrogram to determine that the bladder fills and stores properly. The patient then is asked to stand upright with a full bladder and to cough or otherwise exert abdominal pressure on his bladder. If the patient leaks, the diagnosis of ISD is established.</p>

<p> In female patients, the evaluation must include a complete history and physical examination (including a pelvic exam) and a simple cystometrogram to rule out abnormalities of bladder compliance and abnormalities of urethral support. Following that determination, an abdominal leak point pressure (ALLP) test is performed. Leak point pressure, stated in cm H2O, is defined as the intra-abdominal pressure at which leakage occurs from the bladder (around a catheter) when the bladder has been filled with a minimum of 150 cc fluid. If the patient has an ALLP of less than 100 cm H2O, the diagnosis of ISD is established.</p>

<p> To use a collagen implant, physicians must have urology training in the use of a cystoscope and must complete a collagen implant training program.</p>

<p> Coverage of a collagen implant, and the procedure to inject it, is limited to the following types of patients with stress urinary incontinence due to ISD:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Male or female patients with congenital sphincter weakness secondary to conditions such as myelomeningocele or epispadias;</li>

<li> Male or female patients with acquired sphincter weakness secondary to spinal cord lesions;</li>

<li> Male patients following trauma, including prostatectomy and/or radiation; and</li>

<li> Female patients without urethral hypermobility and with abdominal leak point pressures of 100 cm H2O or less.</li>
</ul>

<p> Patients whose incontinence does not improve with 5 injection procedures (5 separate treatment sessions) are considered treatment failures, and no further treatment of urinary incontinence by collagen implant is covered. Patients who have a reoccurrence of incontinence following successful treatment with collagen implants in the past (e.g., 6-12 months previously) may benefit from additional treatment sessions. Coverage of additional sessions may be allowed but must be supported by medical justification.</p>","See the <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS012673"">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual</a>, Chapter 15","","89",1996-09-01 00:00:00,"","",25,"<p> 09/1996 - Revised coverage guidelines.

For example, educational activities carried out by nurses such as teaching patients to give themselves injections, follow prescribed diets, administer colostomy care, administer medical gases, and carry out other inpatient care activities may be reimbursable as a part of covered routine nursing care. Also, the teaching by an occupational therapist of compensatory techniques to improve a patient's level of independence in the activities of daily living may be reimbursed as a part of covered occupational therapy. Similarly, the instruction of a patient in the carrying out of a maintenance program designed for him/her by a physical therapist may be reimbursed as part of covered physical therapy.</p>

<p> However, when the educational activities are not closely related to the care and treatment of the patient, such as programs directed toward instructing patients or the public generally in preventive health care activities, reimbursement cannot be made since the Act limits Medicare payment to covered care which is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of an illness or injury. For example, programs designed to prevent illness by instructing the general public in the importance of good nutritional habits, exercise regimens, and good hygiene are not reimbursable under Medicare.</p>

<p>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is a diagnostic test that allows for the identification of various types of high blood pressure (BP). ABPM devices are small portable machines that are connected to a blood pressure cuff worn by patients that record blood pressure at regular periods over 24 to 48 hours while the patient goes about their normal activities, including sleep. The recording is interpreted by a physician or non-physician practitioner, and appropriate action is taken based on the findings. Diagnosis and treatment of high BP is important for the management of various conditions including cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.</p>","<br><p><strong>B.

<li>For beneficiaries with suspected masked hypertension, which is defined as average office BP between 120 mm Hg and 129 mm Hg for systolic BP, or between 75 mm HG and 79 mm Hg for diastolic BP on two separate clinic/office visits with at least two separate measurements made at each visit, and at least two BP measurements taken outside the office which are &ge; 130/80 mm Hg.</li>
</ol>
<p>ABPM devices must be:
<ul>
<li>capable of producing standardized plots of BP measurements for 24 hours with daytime and night-time windows and normal BP bands demarcated; and,</li>
<li>provided to patients with oral and written instructions and a test run in the physician’s office must be performed; and,</li>

<p><strong>A. General</strong></p>

<p>Section 4103 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides for coverage of certain prostate cancer screening tests subject to certain coverage, frequency, and payment limitations. Medicare will cover prostate cancer screening tests/procedures for the early detection of prostate cancer. Coverage of prostate cancer screening tests includes the following procedures furnished to an individual for the early detection of prostate cancer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screening digital rectal examination; and</li>

<li>Screening prostate specific antigen blood test</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B. Screening Digital Rectal Examinations</strong></p>

<p>Screening digital rectal examinations are covered at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare-covered screening digital rectal examination was performed). Screening digital rectal examination means a clinical examination of an individual's prostate for nodules or other abnormalities of the prostate. This screening must be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in &#167;1861(r)(1) of the Act), or by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife (as defined in &#167;1861(aa) and &#167;1861(gg) of the Act) who is authorized under State law to perform the examination, fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem.</p>

<p><strong>C. Screening Prostate Specific Antigen Tests</strong></p>

<p>Screening prostate specific antigen tests are covered at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare-covered screening prostate specific antigen test was performed). Screening prostate specific antigen tests (PSA) means a test to detect the marker for adenocarcinoma of prostate. PSA is a reliable immunocytochemical marker for primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostate. This screening must be ordered by the beneficiary's physician or by the beneficiary's physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife (the term ""attending physician"" is defined in &#167;1861(r)(1) of the Act to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and the terms ""physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife"" are defined in &#167;1861(aa) and &#167;1861(gg) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and who would be responsible for using the results of any examination (test) performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem.</p>","","","48",2006-03-17 00:00:00,"https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/Downloads/R48NCD.pdf","4278",25,"<p>01/2024 - Transmittal 12355 issued November 09, 2023, is being rescinded and replaced by Transmittal 12444, January 4, 2024 to add clarifying verbiage to NCD 90.2, business requirement 13278.2, and related edits to NCD 90.2, Next Generation Sequencing, attached spreadsheet.

<p>Use of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) - standard measurement for reporting the blood's clotting time - allows physicians to determine the level of anticoagulation in a patient independent of the laboratory reagents used. The INR is the ratio of the patient's PT (extrinsic or tissue-factor coagulation pathway) compared to the mean PT for a group of normal individuals. Maintaining patients within his/her prescribed therapeutic range minimizes adverse events associated with inadequate or excessive anticoagulation such as serious bleeding or thromboembolic events. Patient self-testing and self-management through the use of a home INR monitor may be used to improve the time in therapeutic rate (TTR) for select groups of patients. Increased TTR leads to improved clinical outcomes and reductions in thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.</p> 
 
<p>Warfarin (also prescribed under other trade names, e.g., Coumadin&#174;) is a self-administered, oral anticoagulant (blood thinner) medication that affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. It is widely used for various medical conditions, and has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning it is a drug with less than a 2-fold difference between median lethal dose and median effective dose. For this reason, since October 4, 2006, it falls under the category of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &#8220;black-box&#8221; drug whose dosage must be closely monitored to avoid serious complications. A PT/INR monitoring system is a portable testing device that includes a finger-stick and an FDA-cleared meter that measures the time it takes for a person&#8217;s blood plasma to clot.</p>","<p><strong>B.

<ol type=""1"">     
<li>The patient must have been anticoagulated for at least 3 months prior to use of the home INR device;and,</li> 
 
<li>The patient must undergo a face-to-face educational program on anticoagulation management and must have demonstrated the correct use of the device prior to its use in the home; and,</li> 
 
<li>The patient continues to correctly use the device in the context of the management of the anticoagulation therapy following the initiation of home monitoring; and,</li>

<p>The sNCT is a psychophysical assessment of both central and peripheral nerve functions. It measures the detection threshold of accurately calibrated sensory stimuli. This procedure is intended to evaluate and quantify function in both large and small caliber fibers for the purpose of detecting neurologic disease. Sensory perception and threshold detection are dependent on the integrity of both the peripheral sensory apparatus and peripheral-central sensory pathways. In theory, an abnormality detected by this procedure may signal dysfunction anywhere in the sensory pathway from the receptors, the sensory tracts, the primary sensory cortex, to the association cortex.</p>

<p>This procedure is different and distinct from assessment of nerve conduction velocity, amplitude and latency. It is also different from short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials.</p>

<p>Effective October 1, 2002, CMS initially concluded that there was insufficient scientific or clinical evidence to consider the sNCT test and the device used in performing this test reasonable and necessary within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the law. Therefore, sNCT was noncovered.</p>

<p>Effective April 1, 2004, based on a reconsideration of current Medicare policy for sNCT, CMS concludes that the use of any type of sNCT device (e.g., &#8220;current output&#8221; type device used to perform current perception threshold (CPT), pain perception threshold (PPT), or pain tolerance threshold (PTT) testing or &#8220;voltage input&#8221; type device used for voltage-nerve conduction threshold (v-NCT) testing) to diagnose sensory neuropathies or radiculopathies in Medicare beneficiaries is not reasonable and necessary.</p>","<p><strong>B.

<p>Speech generating devices are considered to fall within the durable medical equipment (DME) benefit category established by &sect;1861(n) of the Social Security Act. They are covered for patients who suffer from a severe speech impairment and have a medical condition that warrants the use of a device based on the following definitions.</p>    
  
<p>Speech generating devices are defined as durable medical equipment that provides an individual who has a severe speech impairment with the ability to meet his or her functional, speaking needs. Speech generating devices are speech aids consisting of devices or software that generate speech and are used solely by the individual who has a severe speech impairment. The speech is generated using one of the following methods:</p>  
  
<ul><li>digitized audible/verbal speech output, using prerecorded messages;  </li>  
<li>synthesized audible/verbal speech output which requires message formulation by spelling and device access by physical contact with the device-direct selection techniques;  
</li>  
<li>synthesized audible/verbal speech output which permits multiple methods of message formulation and multiple methods of device access; or  </li>  
<li>software that allows a computer or other electronic device to generate audible/verbal speech.  </li></ul>  
  
<p>Other covered features of the device include the capability to generate email, text, or phone messages to allow the patient to “speak” or communicate remotely, as well as the capability to download updates to the covered features of the device from the manufacturer or supplier of the device.</p>  
  
<p>If a speech generating device is limited to use by a patient with a severe speech impairment and is primarily used for the purpose of generating speech, it is not necessary for the device to be dedicated only to audible/verbal speech output to be considered DME. Computers and tablets are generally not considered DME because they are useful in the absence of an illness or injury.</p>","<strong><p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<strong><p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p></strong>  
  
<p>Internet or phone services or any modification to a patient’s home to allow use of the speech generating device are not covered by Medicare because such services or modifications could be used for non-medical equipment such as standard phones or personal computers. In addition, specific features of a speech generating device that are not used by the individual who has a severe speech impairment to meet his or her functional speaking needs are not covered. This would include any computing hardware or software not  necessary to allow for generation of audible/verbal speech, email, text or phone messages, such as hardware or software used to create documents and spreadsheets or play games or music, and any other function a computer can perform that is not directly related to meeting the functional speaking communication needs of the patient, including video communications or conferencing. These features of a speech generating device do not fall within the scope of  &sect; 1861(n) of the Social Security Act and the cost of these features are the responsibility of the beneficiary. Suppliers of speech generating devices are encouraged to furnish the beneficiary with a voluntary Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN), or similar notice, which informs that these features are not covered and to alert the beneficiary of the expense of these features.</p>

<p>    Medicare covers intestinal and multi-visceral transplantation for the purpose of restoring intestinal function in patients with irreversible intestinal failure. Intestinal failure is defined as the loss of absorptive capacity of the small bowel secondary to severe primary gastrointestinal disease or surgically induced short bowel syndrome. It may be associated with both mortality and profound morbidity. Multi-visceral transplantation includes organs in the digestive system (stomach, duodenum, pancreas, liver and intestine).</p>

<p>    The evidence supports the fact that aged patients generally do not survive as well as younger patients receiving intestinal transplantation. Nonetheless, some older patients who are free from other contraindications have received the procedure and are progressing well, as evidenced by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data. Thus, it is not appropriate to include specific exclusions from coverage, such as an age limitation, in the national coverage policy.</p>","<p>   <strong> B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>   Effective for services performed on or after April 1, 2001, this procedure is covered only when performed for patients who have failed total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and only when performed in centers that meet approval criteria.</p>

<p>   1. Failed TPN</p>

<p>   The TPN delivers nutrients intravenously, avoiding the need for absorption through the small bowel. TPN failure includes the following:</p>
 
<ul>   
<li>   Impending or overt liver failure due to TPN induced liver injury. The clinical manifestations include elevated serum bilirubin and/or liver enzymes, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, gastroesophageal varices, coagulopathy, stomal bleeding or hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis.</li>

<li>   Thrombosis of the major central venous channels; jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins. Thrombosis of two or more of these vessels is considered a life threatening complication and failure of TPN therapy. The sequelae of central venous thrombosis are lack of access for TPN infusion, fatal sepsis due to infected thrombi, pulmonary embolism, Superior Vena Cava syndrome, or chronic venous insufficiency.</li>

<li>   Frequent line infection and sepsis. The development of two or more episodes of systemic sepsis secondary to line infection per year that requires hospitalization indicates failure of TPN therapy. A single episode of line related fungemia, septic shock and/or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome are considered indicators of TPN failure.</li>

<li>   Frequent episodes of severe dehydration despite intravenous fluid supplement in addition to TPN. Under certain medical conditions such as secretory diarrhea and non-constructable gastrointestinal tract, the loss of the gastrointestinal and pancreatobiliary secretions exceeds the maximum intravenous infusion rates that can be tolerated by the cardiopulmonary system. Frequent episodes of dehydration are deleterious to all body organs particularly kidneys and the central nervous system with the development of multiple kidney stones, renal failure, and permanent brain damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>   2. Approved Transplant Facilities</p>

<p>   Intestinal transplantation is covered by Medicare if performed in an approved facility. The criteria for approval of centers will be based on a volume of 10 intestinal transplants per year with a 1-year actuarial survival of 65 percent using the Kaplan-Meier technique.</p>

<p>Sections 1861(s)(2)(R) and 1861(pp) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and regulations at 42 CFR 410.37 authorize Medicare coverage for screening colorectal cancer tests under Medicare Part B. The statute and regulations authorize the Secretary to add other tests and procedures (and modifications to tests and procedures for colorectal cancer screening) as the Secretary finds appropriate based on consultation with appropriate organizations.</p>","<p><strong></p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT) (effective January 1, 2004)</p></strong>
<p>Fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) are generally divided into two types: immunoassay and guaiac types. Immunoassay (or immunochemical) fecal occult blood tests (iFOBT) use “antibodies directed against human globin epitopes. While most iFOBTs use spatulas to collect stool samples, some use a brush to collect toilet water surrounding the stool. Most iFOBTs require laboratory processing.</p>
<p>Guaiac fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) use a peroxidase reaction to indicate presence of the heme portion of hemoglobin. Guaiac turns blue after oxidation by oxidants or peroxidases in the presence of an oxygen donor such as hydrogen peroxide. Most FOBTs use sticks to collect stool samples and may be developed in a physician’s office or a laboratory. In 1998, Medicare began reimbursement for guaiac FOBTs, but not immunoassay type tests for colorectal cancer screening. Since the fundamental process is similar for other iFOBTs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services evaluated colorectal cancer screening using immunoassay FOBTs in general.</p>
<p>Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2004, Medicare covers one screening FOBT per annum for the early detection of colorectal cancer. This means that Medicare will cover one gFOBT or one iFOBT at a frequency of every 12 months; i.e., at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last covered screening FOBT was performed, for beneficiaries aged 50 years and older. The beneficiary completes the existing gFOBT by taking samples from two different sites of three consecutive stools; the beneficiary completes the iFOBT by taking the appropriate number of stool samples according to the specific manufacturer’s instructions. This screening requires a written order from the beneficiary’s attending physician. (“Attending physician” means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in §1861(r)(1) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary’s medical condition, and who would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of the beneficiary’s specific medical problem.)</p>
	
<p>Effective January 1, 2023, the minimum age for FOBT is reduced to 45 years and older.</p>

<p><strong>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cologuard&#8482; – Multi-target Stool DNA (sDNA) Test (effective October 9, 2014)</p></strong>
<p>Screening stool or fecal DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, sDNA) testing detects molecular markers of altered DNA that are contained in the cells shed by colorectal cancer and pre-malignant colorectal epithelial neoplasia into the lumen of the large bowel. Through the use of selective enrichment and amplification techniques, sDNA tests are designed to detect very small amounts of DNA markers to identify colorectal cancer or pre-malignant colorectal neoplasia. The Cologuard&#8482; – multi-target sDNA test is a proprietary in vitro diagnostic device that incorporates both sDNA and fecal immunochemical test techniques and is designed to analyze patients’ stool samples for markers associated with the presence of colorectal cancer and pre-malignant colorectal neoplasia.</p>

<p>Effective for dates of service on or after October 9, 2014, The Cologuard&#8482; test is covered once every three years for Medicare beneficiaries that meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Age 50 to 85 years, and,</li>
<li>Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including but not limited to lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (iFOBT)), and,</li>
<li>At average risk of developing colorectal cancer (no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).</li></ul>

<p>Effective January 1, 2023, the minimum age for sDNA is reduced to 45 years and older.</p>

<strong><p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood-based Biomarker Tests (effective January 19, 2021)</p></strong>

<p>Blood-based DNA testing detects molecular markers of altered DNA that are contained in the cells shed into the blood by colorectal cancer and pre-malignant colorectal epithelial neoplasia.</p>

<p>Effective for dates of service on or after January 19, 2021, a blood-based biomarker test is covered as an appropriate colorectal cancer screening test once every 3 years for Medicare beneficiaries when performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory, when ordered by a treating physician and when all of the following requirements are met:</p>

<p>The patient is:</p>
	<ul><li>age 50-85 years, and,</li>
<li>asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including but not limited to lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and,</li>
<li>at average risk of developing colorectal cancer (no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).</li></ul></p>

<p>The blood-based biomarker screening test must have all of the following:</p>

<ul><li>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) market authorization with an indication for colorectal cancer screening; and,</li>
<li>proven test performance characteristics for a blood-based screening test with both sensitivity greater than or equal to 74% and specificity greater than or equal to 90% in the detection of colorectal cancer compared to the recognized standard (accepted as colonoscopy at this time), as minimal threshold levels, based on the pivotal studies included in the FDA labeling.</li></ul>

In addition to providing visualization, arthroscopy enables the process of joint cleansing through the use of lavage or irrigation. Lavage alone may involve either large or small volume saline irrigation of the knee by arthroscopy. Although generally performed to reduce pain and improve function, current practice does not recognize the benefit of lavage alone for the reduction of mechanical symptoms. Arthroscopy also permits the removal of any loose bodies from the interior joint space, a procedure termed debridement. Debridement, when used alone or not otherwise specified, may include low volume lavage or washout. Osteoarthritis is a chronic and painful joint disease caused by degeneration. The American College of Rheumatology defines a patient diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee as presenting with pain, and meeting at least 5 of the following criteria:</p>

Outerbridge is the most commonly used clinical scale that classifies the severity of joint degeneration of the knee by compartments and grades. Grade I is defined as softening or blistering of joint cartilage. Grade II is defined as fragmentation or fissuring in an area &lt;1 cm.

One of the desired patient outcomes is insulin independence. Elimination of clinically significant hypoglycemia episodes and improved glucose control are other important patient outcomes. 

<p>One or more pancreata are obtained from donor(s). The islets must be removed within hours after the recovery of the donor pancreas to ensure viability. The islet cells are transplanted by injection into the portal vein of the recipient either using direct visualization, guided ultrasound or percutaneously. The islet cell transplant may be performed alone, in combination with a kidney transplant, or after a kidney transplant.  Islet recipients require immunosuppressant therapy to prevent rejection of the transplanted islet cells. Routine follow-up care is necessary for each trial participant.</p>","<strong><p>  B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>  Medicare will pay for the routine costs, as well as transplantation and appropriate related items and services, for Medicare beneficiaries participating in a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored clinical trial(s). The term 'routine costs' means reasonable and necessary routine patient care costs, including immunosuppressive drugs and other follow-up care, as defined in section <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=1&ncdver=2&DocID=310.1&SearchType=Advanced&bc=EAAAAAgAAAAA&"">310.1</a> of the NCD Manual.</p>

<p>  Specifically, Medicare will cover transplantation of pancreatic islet cells, the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Coverage will include the costs of acquisition and delivery of the pancreatic islet cells, as well as clinically necessary inpatient and outpatient medical care and immunosuppressants.</p>

<strong><p>  C. Nationally Noncovered Indications</p></strong>

<p>  Partial pancreatic tissue transplantation or islet cell transplantation performed outside the context of a clinical trial continues to be noncovered.</p>

<p>   Medicare covers FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans for either the differential diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) under specific requirements; OR, its use in a Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)-approved practical clinical trial focused on the utility of FDG PET in the diagnosis or treatment of dementing neurodegenerative diseases. Specific requirements for each indication are clarified below:</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li> <p><strong>FDG PET Requirements for Coverage in the Differential Diagnosis of AD and FTD</strong></p> 
 
<p>An  FDG PET scan is considered reasonable and necessary in patients with a recent diagnosis of dementia and documented cognitive decline of at least 6 months, who meet diagnostic criteria for both AD and FTD. These patients have been evaluated for specific alternate neurodegenerative diseases or other causative factors, but the cause of the clinical symptoms remains uncertain.</p> 
 
<p>The following additional conditions must be met before an  FDG PET scan will be covered:</p> 
 
<ol start=""1"" type=""a""><li> 
<p> The patient&#8217;s onset, clinical presentation, or course of cognitive impairment is such that FTD is suspected as an alternative neurodegenerative cause of the cognitive decline. Specifically, symptoms such as social disinhibition, awkwardness, difficulties with language, or loss of executive function are more prominent early in the course of FTD than the memory loss typical of AD;</p> 
</li> 
 
<li> <p>The patient has had a comprehensive clinical evaluation (as defined by the American Academy of Neurology encompassing a medical history from the patient and a well-acquainted informant (including assessment of activities of daily living), physical and mental status examination (including formal documentation of cognitive decline occurring over at least 6 months) aided by cognitive scales or neuropsychological testing, laboratory tests, and structural imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT);</p> </li> 
 
<li> <p>The evaluation of the patient has been conducted by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and assessment of dementia;</p> </li> 
 
<li> <p> The evaluation of the patient did not clearly determine a specific neurodegenerative disease or other cause for the clinical symptoms, and information available through  FDG PET is reasonably expected to help clarify the diagnosis between FTD and AD and help guide future treatment;</p> </li> 
 
<li> <p>The  FDG PET scan is performed in a facility that has all the accreditation necessary to operate nuclear medicine equipment. The reading of the scan should be done by an expert in nuclear medicine, radiology, neurology, or psychiatry, with experience interpreting such scans in the presence of dementia;</p> </li> 
 
<li> <p>A brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or  FDG PET scan has not been obtained for the same indication. (The indication can be considered to be different in patients who exhibit important changes in scope or severity of cognitive decline, and meet all other qualifying criteria listed above and below (including the judgment that the likely diagnosis remains uncertain.)  The results of a prior SPECT or  FDG PET scan must have been inconclusive or, in the case of SPECT, difficult to interpret due to immature or inadequate technology. In these instances, an  FDG PET scan may be covered after one year has passed from the time the first SPECT or  FDG PET scan was performed.)</p> </li> 
 
<li> <p>The referring and billing provider(s) have documented the appropriate evaluation of the Medicare beneficiary. Providers should establish the medical necessity of an  FDG PET scan by ensuring that the following information has been collected and is maintained in the beneficiary medical record:<br> </p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Date of onset of symptoms;</li> 
 
<li>Diagnosis of clinical syndrome (normal aging; mild cognitive impairment  (MCI); mild, moderate or severe dementia);</li> 
 
<li>Mini mental status exam (MMSE) or similar test score;</li> 
 
<li>Presumptive cause (possible, probable, uncertain AD);</li> 
 
<li>Any neuropsychological testing performed;</li> 
 
<li>Results of any structural imaging (MRI or CT) performed;</li> 
 
<li>Relevant laboratory tests (B12, thyroid hormone); and,</li> 
 
<li>Number and name of prescribed medications.</li> 
</ul> 
</li></ol> 
 
<p>The billing provider must furnish a copy of the  FDG PET scan result for use by CMS and its Medicare Administrative Contractors upon request. These verification requirements are consistent with Federal requirements set forth in 42 Code of Federal Regulations, section 410.32 generally for diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other tests. In summary, section 410.32 requires the billing physician and the referring physician to maintain information in the medical record of each patient to demonstrate medical necessity [410.32(d) (2)] and submit the information demonstrating medical necessity to CMS and/or its agents upon request [410.32(d)(3)(I)] (OMB number 0938-0685).</p> 
</li> 
 
<li> <p><strong>FDG PET Requirements for Coverage in the Context of a CMS-approved Practical Clinical Trial Utilizing a Specific Protocol to Demonstrate the Utility of  FDG PET in the Diagnosis, and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Dementing Diseases</strong></p> 
 
<p>An FDG PET scan is considered reasonable and necessary in patients with MCI or early dementia (in clinical circumstances other than those specified in subparagraph 1) only in the context of an approved clinical trial that contains patient safeguards and protections to ensure proper administration, use and evaluation of the  FDG PET scan.</p> 
 
<p>The clinical trial must compare patients who do and do not receive an  FDG PET scan and have as its goal to monitor, evaluate, and improve clinical outcomes. In addition, it must meet the following basic criteria:</p> 
 
<ol type=""a""> 
<li>Written protocol on file;</li> 
 
<li>Institutional Review Board review and approval;</li> 
 
<li>Scientific review and approval by two or more qualified individuals who are not part of the research team; and,</li> 
 
<li>Certification that investigators have not been disqualified.</li> 
</ol> 
</li></ol> 
 
<p><strong>C. Nationally Non-  Covered Indications</strong></p> 
 
<p>All other uses of  FDG PET for patients with a presumptive diagnosis of dementia-causing neurodegenerative disease (e.g., possible or probable AD, clinically typical FTD, dementia of Lewy bodies, or Creutzfeld-Jacob disease) for which CMS has not specifically indicated coverage continue to be noncovered.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can range from mild to severe, with the most severe cases resulting in dehydration, malnutrition, metabolic imbalances, and potential withdrawal from future chemotherapy treatments. The incidence and severity of CINV are influenced by the specific chemotherapeutic agent(s) used; dosage, schedule and route of administration; and drug combinations. Patient specific risk factors such as gender, age, history of motion sickness, and prior `exposure to chemotherapeutic agents can also have an effect on CINV incidence and severity. Progress has been made in reducing CINV, although it can still be hard to control symptoms that occur more than a day after chemotherapy, during repeat cycles of chemotherapy, and when chemotherapy is given on more than one day or in very high doses. No single antiemetic agent is completely effective in all patients. As noted above, many factors influence the incidence and severity of CINV, with the specific chemotherapeutic agent as the primary factor to consider when deciding which antiemetic to administer. Aprepitant (Emend&reg;) is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug of its type. Aprepitant has been proposed to function in combination with other oral antiemetics for a specified population of Medicare patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy and/or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.</p>   
   
<p>CMS is defining highly emetogenic chemotherapy and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as those anticancer agents so designated in at least two of three guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)/Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC). The inclusive examples are: NCCN plus ASCO, NCCN plus ESMO/MASCC, or ASCO plus ESMO/MASCC.</p>","<br><p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>   
<p>Effective for services performed between April 4, 2005, and May 28, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services makes the following determinations regarding the use of aprepitant in the treatment of reducing chemotherapy-induced emesis:</p>   
<p>The evidence is adequate to conclude that the use of the oral antiemetic three-drug combination of oral aprepitant (Emend&reg;), an oral 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, and oral dexamethasone is reasonable and necessary for a specified patient population. We have defined the patient population for which the use of the oral antiemetic three-drug combination of oral aprepitant (Emend&reg;), an oral 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, and oral dexamethasone is reasonable and necessary as only those patients who are receiving one or more of the following anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents:</p>   
   
<ul>   
<li>Carmustine</li>   
<li>Cisplatin</li>   
<li>Cyclophosphamide</li>   
<li>Dacarbazine</li>   
<li>Mechlorethamine</li>   
<li>Streptozocin</li>   
<li>Doxorubicin</li>   
<li>Epirubicin</li>   
<li>Lomustine</li></ul>   
   
<p>Effective for services performed on or after May 29, 2013, the oral three-drug regimen of oral aprepitant, an oral 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist and oral dexamethasone is reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries receiving, either singularly or in combination with other drugs the following anticancer chemotherapeutic agents:</p>   
   
<ul><li>Alemtuzumab</li>   
<li>Azacitidine</li>   
<li>Bendamustine</li>   
<li>Carboplatin</li>   
<li>Carmustine</li>   
<li>Cisplatin</li>   
<li>Clofarabine</li>   
<li>Cyclophosphamide</li>   
<li>Cytarabine</li>   
<li>Dacarbazine</li>   
<li>Daunorubicin</li>   
<li>Doxorubicin</li>   
<li>Epirubicin</li>   
<li>Idarubicin</li>   
<li>Ifosfamide</li>   
<li>Irinotecan</li>   
<li>Lomustine</li>   
<li>Mechlorethamine</li>   
<li>Oxaliplatin</li>   
<li>Streptozocin</li></ul>   
   
<p>The oral three drug regimen must be administered immediately before and within 48 hours after the administration of these chemotherapeutic agents.</p>   
   
<p><strong>C. Nationally Noncovered Indications</strong></p>   
<p>The evidence is adequate to conclude that aprepitant cannot function alone as a full replacement for intravenously administered antiemetic agents for patients who are receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy and/or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Medicare does not cover under Part B for oral antiemetic drugs in antiemetic drug combination regimens that are administered in part, via an oral route and in part, via an intravenous route. Medicare does not cover under Part B aprepitant when it is used alone for anticancer chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting.</p>   
   
<p><strong>D. Other</strong></p>   
<p>Medicare Administrative Contractors may determine coverage for other all-oral three-drug antiemesis regimens of aprepitant or any other FDA approved oral NK-1 antagonist in combination with an oral 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist and oral dexamethasone with the chemotherapeutic agents listed above, or any other anticancer chemotherapeutic agents that are FDA approved and are defined as highly or moderately emetogenic.</p>

<p>Microvolt T-wave Alternans (MTWA) testing is a non-invasive diagnostic test that detects minute electrical activity in a portion of the electrocardiogram (ECG) known as the T-wave. MTWA testing has a role in the stratification of patients who may be at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias.</p> 
 
<p>Within patient groups that may be considered candidates for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, a negative MTWA test may be useful in identifying low-risk patients who are unlikely to benefit from, and who may experience worse outcomes from, ICD placement.</p> 
 
<p>Spectral analysis (SA) is a sensitive mathematical method of measuring and comparing time and the ECG signals. It requires specialized propriety electrodes to calculate minute T-wave voltage changes. Software then analyzes these microvolt changes and produces a report to be interpreted by a physician. The Modified Moving Average (MMA) method uses a temporal domain in which T-wave alternans are assessed as a continuous variable along the complete ECG.

<p>Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas that comprises 21 percent of the atmospheric gases at sea level. Historically, long term supplemental oxygen has been administered in higher than atmospheric concentrations to patients with chronic hypoxemia, generally resulting from cardiac and/or pulmonary disease. The need for supplemental oxygen is assessed by direct or indirect measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen (conventionally expressed in millimeters of mercury, mmHg) and the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood (expressed as a percent). Chronic oxygen therapy is generally administered via nasal cannulae, face mask, or tracheostomy, from a stationary or portable oxygen tank or an oxygen concentrator.</p>

<p>      The blood brain barrier (BBB) of the central nervous system is characterized by tight junctions between vascular endothelial cells, which prevent or impede various naturally occurring and synthetic substances (including anti-cancer drugs) from entering brain tissue. The BBB may be partly responsible for the poor efficacy of chemotherapy for malignant primary or metastatic brain tumors.</p>

<p>     The BBBD is the disruption of the tight junctions between the endothelial cells that line the capillaries in the brain accomplished by osmotic disruption, bradykinin or irradiation. Theoretically, disruption of the BBB may, in the treatment of brain tumors, increase the concentration of chemotherapy drugs delivered to the tumor and may prolong the drug-tumor contact time.</p>

<p>     Osmotic disruption of the BBB is the most common technique used. Chemotherapeutic agents are given in conjunction with barrier disruption.

<p>    Pulmonary rehabilitation was defined in a 1999 joint statement of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as a multi-disciplinary program of care for patients with chronic respiratory impairment that is individually tailored and designed to optimize physical and social performance and autonomy and an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities.

<p>Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are characterized by airflow limitation that may be partially or completely reversible. Pharmacologic treatment with bronchodilators is used to prevent and/or control daily symptoms that may cause disability for persons with these diseases. These medications are intended to improve the movement of air into and from the lungs by relaxing and dilating the bronchial passageways. Beta adrenergic agonists are a commonly prescribed class of bronchodilator drug. They can be administered via nebulizer, metered dose inhaler, orally, or dry powdered inhaler.</p>

<p>    Percutaneous thermal intradiscal procedures (TIPs) involve the insertion of a catheter(s)/probe(s) in the spinal disc under fluoroscopic guidance for the purpose of producing or applying heat and/or disruption within the disc to relieve low back pain.</p>

<p>  The scope of this national coverage determination on TIPs includes percutaneous intradiscal techniques that employ the use of a radiofrequency energy source or electrothermal energy to apply or create heat and/or disruption within the disc for coagulation and/or decompression of disc material to treat symptomatic patients with annular disruption of a contained herniated disc, to seal annular tears or fissures, or destroy nociceptors for the purpose of relieving pain. This includes techniques that use single or multiple probe(s)/catheter(s), which utilize a resistance coil or other delivery system technology, are flexible or rigid, and are placed within the nucleus, the nuclear-annular junction, or the annulus.</p>

<p>   Although not intended to be an all inclusive list, TIPs are commonly identified as intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), intradiscal thermal annuloplasty (IDTA), percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PIRFT), radiofrequency annuloplasty (RA), intradiscal biacuplasty (IDB), percutaneous (or plasma) disc decompression (PDD) or coblation, or targeted disc decompression (TDD). At times, TIPs are identified or labeled based on the name of the catheter/probe that is used (e.g., SpineCath, discTRODE, SpineWand, Accutherm, or TransDiscal electrodes). Each technique or device has it own protocol for application of the therapy. Percutaneous disc decompression or nucleoplasty procedures that do not utilize a radiofrequency energy source or electrothermal energy (such as the disc decompressor procedure or laser procedure) are not within the scope of this NCD.</p>","<p><strong>B.

<p> Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the collapse of the oropharyngeal walls and the obstruction of airflow occurring during sleep. Diagnostic tests for OSA have historically been classified into four types. The most comprehensive is designated Type I attended facility based polysomnography (PSG), which is considered the reference standard for diagnosing OSA. Attended facility based polysomnogram is a comprehensive diagnostic sleep test including at least electroencephalography (EEG), electro-oculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), heart rate or electrocardiography (ECG), airflow, breathing/respiratory effort, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) furnished in a sleep laboratory facility in which a technologist supervises the recording during sleep time and has the ability to intervene if needed. Overnight PSG is the conventional diagnostic test for OSA. The American Thoracic Society and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine have recommended supervised PSG in the sleep laboratory over 2 nights for the diagnosis of OSA and the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).</p>

<p> Three categories of portable monitors (used both in attended and unattended settings) have been developed for the diagnosis of OSA. Type II monitors have a minimum of 7 channels (e.g., EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG-heart rate, airflow, breathing/respiratory effort, SaO<sub>2</sub>)-this type of device monitors sleep staging, so AHI can be calculated). Type III monitors have a minimum of 4 monitored channels including ventilation or airflow (at least two channels of respiratory movement or respiratory movement and airflow), heart rate or ECG, and oxygen saturation. Type IV devices may measure one, two, three or more parameters but do not meet all the criteria of a higher category device. Some monitors use an actigraphy algorithm to identify periods of sleep and wakefulness.</p>","<p><strong>   B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>1. Type I PSG is covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiaries who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed attended in a sleep lab facility.</p>

<p>FDG (2-[F18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a minimally-invasive diagnostic imaging procedure used to evaluate glucose metabolism in normal tissue as well as in diseased tissues in conditions such as cancer, ischemic heart disease, and some neurologic disorders. FDG is an injected radionuclide (or radiopharmaceutical) that emits sub-atomic particles, known as positrons, as it decays. FDG PET uses a positron camera (tomograph) to measure the decay of FDG. The rate of FDG decay provides biochemical information on glucose metabolism in the tissue being studied. As malignancies can cause abnormalities of metabolism and blood flow, FDG PET evaluation may indicate the probable presence or absence of a malignancy based upon observed differences in biologic activity compared to adjacent tissues.</p>   
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was asked by the National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR) to reconsider section <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/ncd-details.aspx?NCDId=211&ncdver=5"">220.6</a> of the National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual to end the prospective data collection requirements under Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) across all oncologic indications of FDG PET imaging. The CMS received public input indicating that the current coverage framework of prospective data collection under CED be ended for all oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging.</p>   
   
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Framework</p>
<p>Effective for claims with dates of service on and after June 11, 2013, CMS is adopting a coverage framework that ends the prospective data collection requirements by NOPR under CED for all oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging.  CMS is making this change for all NCDs that address coverage of FDG PET for oncologic uses addressed in this decision. This decision does not change coverage for any use of PET imaging using radiopharmaceuticals NaF-18 (fluorine-18 labeled sodium fluoride), ammonia N-13, or rubidium-82 (Rb-82).</p>   
   
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy</p>   
<p>CMS continues to believe that the evidence is adequate to determine that the results of FDG PET imaging are useful in determining the appropriate initial anti-tumor treatment strategy for beneficiaries with suspected cancer and improve health outcomes and thus are reasonable and necessary under §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act).</p>   
<p>Therefore, CMS continues to nationally cover one FDG PET study for beneficiaries who have cancers that are biopsy proven or strongly suspected based on other diagnostic testing when the beneficiary’s treating physician determines that the FDG PET study is needed to determine the location and/or extent of the tumor for the following therapeutic purposes related to the initial anti-tumor treatment strategy:</p>   
   
<ul>   
	<li>To determine whether or not the beneficiary is an appropriate candidate for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure; or</li>   
	<li>To determine the optimal anatomic location for an invasive procedure; or</li>   
	<li>To determine the anatomic extent of tumor when the recommended anti-tumor treatment reasonably depends on the extent of the tumor.</li>   
</ul>   
   
<p>See the table at the end of this section for a synopsis of all nationally covered and non-covered oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging.</p>","<p>B.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Covered Indications</p>   
   
<ol start=""1"" type=""a"">   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET imaging for the initial anti-tumor treatment strategy for male and female breast cancer only when used in staging distant metastasis.</li>   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET to determine initial anti-tumor treatment strategy for melanoma other than for the evaluation of regional lymph nodes.</li>   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET imaging for the detection of pre-treatment metastasis (i.e., staging) in newly diagnosed cervical cancers following conventional imaging.</li>
	</ol>   
    
<p>C.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p>
   
<ol start=""1"" type=""a"">   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally non-cover initial anti-tumor treatment strategy in Medicare beneficiaries who have adenocarcinoma of the prostate.</li>   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally non-cover FDG PET imaging for diagnosis of breast cancer and initial staging of axillary nodes.</li>   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally non-cover FDG PET imaging for initial anti-tumor treatment strategy for the evaluation of regional lymph nodes in melanoma.</li>   
	<li>CMS continues to nationally non-cover FDG PET imaging for the diagnosis of cervical cancer related to initial anti-tumor treatment strategy.</li>   
</ol>   
   
 <p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy</p>

<p>B.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Covered Indications</p>

<p>Three FDG PET scans are nationally covered when used to guide subsequent management of anti-tumor treatment strategy after completion of initial anti-cancer therapy. Coverage of more than three FDG PET scans to guide subsequent management of anti-tumor treatment strategy after completion of initial anti-cancer therapy shall be determined by the local Medicare Administrative Contractors.</p>

<p>      Warfarin sodium is an orally administered anticoagulant drug that is marketed most commonly as Coumadin&#174;. (The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling for Coumadin&#174; includes a Black Box Warning dating back to 2007.) Anticoagulant drugs are sometimes referred to as blood thinners by the lay public. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide. The elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolic conversion to inactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in liver cells. CYP2C9 is the principal cytochrome P450 enzyme that modulates the anticoagulant activity of warfarin. From results of clinical studies, genetic variation in the CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genes can, in concert with clinical factors, predict how each individual responds to warfarin.</p> 
 
<p>  Pharmacogenomics denotes the study of how an individual's genetic makeup, or genotype, affects the body's response to drugs. Pharmacogenomics as a science examines associations among variations in genes with individual responses to a drug or medication. In application, pharmacogenomic results (i.e., information on the patient&#8217;s genetic variations) can contribute to predicting a patient&#8217;s response to a given drug: good, bad, or none at all. Pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict a patient&#8217;s response to warfarin occurs ideally prior to initiation of the drug. This would be an once-in-a-lifetime test, absent any reason to believe that the patient&#8217;s personal genetic characteristics would change over time. Although such pharmacogenomic testing would be used to attempt to better approximate the best starting dose of warfarin, it would not eliminate the need for periodic PT/INR testing, a standard diagnostic test for coagulation activity and for assessing how a patient is reacting to a warfarin dose.</p>","<p>   <strong>  Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p> 
 
<p>   Effective August 3, 2009, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) believes that the available evidence supports that coverage with evidence development (CED) under &#167;1862(a)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act (the Act) is appropriate for pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness by any method, and is therefore covered only when provided to Medicare beneficiaries who are candidates for anticoagulation therapy with warfarin who:</p> 
 
<ol>   
<li>   Have not been previously tested for CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles; and</li> 
 
<li>   Have received fewer than five days of warfarin in the anticoagulation regimen for which the testing is ordered; and</li> 
 
<li>   Are enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study when that study meets the following standards.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>   A clinical study seeking Medicare payment for pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness provided to the Medicare beneficiary who is a candidate for anticoagulation therapy with warfarin pursuant to CED must address one or more aspects of the following question:</p> 
 
<p>   Prospectively, in Medicare-aged subjects whose warfarin therapy management includes pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin response, what is the frequency and severity of the following outcomes, compared to subjects whose warfarin therapy management does not include pharmacogenomic testing?</p> 
 
<ul>   
<li>   Major hemorrhage</li> 
 
<li>   Minor hemorrhage</li> 
 
<li>   Thromboembolism related to the primary indication for anticoagulation</li> 
 
<li>   Other thromboembolic event</li> 
 
<li>   Mortality</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>   The study must adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:</p> 
 
<ol type=""a"">   
<li>   The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular intervention potentially improves the participants&#8217; health outcomes.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study is well-supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of executing the proposed study successfully.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it also must be in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56.</li> 
 
<li>   All aspects of the research study are conducted according to the appropriate standards of scientific integrity.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by reference, the Medicare standards.</li> 
 
<li>   The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition being studied is life-threatening as defined in 21 CFR &#167; 312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.</li> 
 
<li>   The clinical research study is registered on the www.ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all pre-specified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. However, a full report of the outcomes must be made public no later than 3 years after the end of data collection.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria affect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary.</li> 
 
<li>   The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility.</li>

<p>   12/2009 - There has been considerable public interest in the use of pharmacogenomic testing to predict a patient&#8217;s response to warfarin, an orally administered anticoagulant drug that is marketed most commonly as Coumadin. Anticoagulant drugs are sometimes referred to as ""blood thinners"" by the lay public. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individual&#8217;s genetic makeup, or genotype, affects the body&#8217;s response to drugs. It is an examination of the inherited components and variations in genes that dictate drug/medication response. Pharmacogenomics explores the ways these variations can be used to try to predict whether a patient will have a good response to a drug, a bad response, or no response at all. It is claimed that genetic variability in the CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1genes, in combination with many other factors, may partially predict a patient&#8217;s response to warfarin. On August 4, 2008, CMS opened a National Coverage Analysis.

<p>The term outpatient intravenous (IV) insulin therapy (OIVIT) refers to an outpatient regimen that integrates pulsatile or continuous intravenous infusion of insulin via any means, guided by the results of measurement of:</p>

<ul>        
<li>respiratory quotient; and/or</li>
<li>urine urea nitrogen (UUN); and/or</li>

<p>This regimen is also sometimes termed Cellular Activation Therapy (CAT), Chronic Intermittent Intravenous Insulin Therapy (CIIT), Hepatic Activation Therapy (HAT), Intercellular Activation Therapy (iCAT), Metabolic Activation Therapy (MAT), Pulsatile Intravenous Insulin Treatment (PIVIT), Pulse Insulin Therapy (PIT), and Pulsatile Therapy (PT).</p>

<p>In OIVIT, insulin is intravenously administered in the outpatient setting for a variety of indications. Most commonly, it is delivered in pulses, but it may be delivered as a more conventional drip solution. The insulin administration is adjunctive to the patient's routine diabetic management regimen (oral agent or insulin-based) or other disease management regimen, typically performed on an intermittent basis (often weekly), and frequently performed chronically without duration limits. Glucose or other carbohydrate is available ad libitum (in accordance with patient desire).</p>","<p>  <strong> B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an infection caused by a retrovirus that affects the immune system. HIV infection causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease which severely compromises an individual’s immune system. It is currently generally accepted that antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality throughout the world and the United States, and has transformed HIV disease for many, into a chronic, manageable condition. There is also evidence that the use of ART is associated with a substantially decreased risk for transmission of the virus to uninfected persons.</p>

One of those requirements is that the service(s) be categorized as a Grade A (strongly recommends) or Grade B (recommends) rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The USPSTF gives a Grade A recommendation to screening for HIV in:</p> 
 
<ul>

<li>Persons who request an HIV test despite reporting no individual risk factors,<br> Persons with new sexual partners,</li> 
<li>Persons who, based on individualized physician interview and examination, are deemed to be at increased risk for HIV infection. The determination of “increased risk” for HIV infection is identified by the health care practitioner who assesses the patient’s history, which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical recommendation should be a reflection of the service provided.</li>

<p>   The knee menisci are wedge-shaped, semi-lunar discs of fibrous tissue located in the knee joint between the ends of the femur and the tibia and fibula. There is a lateral and medial meniscus in each knee. It is known now that the menisci provide mechanical support, localized pressure distribution, and lubrication of the knee joint. Initially, meniscal tears were treated with total meniscectomy; however, as knowledge of the function of the menisci and the potential long term effects of total meniscectomy on the knee joint evolved, treatment of symptomatic meniscal tears gravitated to repair of the tear, when possible, or partial meniscectomy.</p>

<p>    The collagen meniscus implant (also referred to as collagen scaffold (CS), CMI or Menaflex&#8482; meniscus implant throughout the published literature) is used to fill meniscal defects that result from partial meniscectomy. The collagen meniscus implant is not intended to replace the entire meniscus at it requires a meniscal rim for attachment. The literature describes the placement of the collagen meniscus implant through an arthroscopic procedure with an additional incision for capture of the repair needles and tying of the sutures. After debridement of the damaged meniscus, the implant is trimmed to the size of meniscal defect and sutured into place. The collagen meniscus implant is described as a tissue engineered scaffold to support the generation of new meniscus-like tissue. The collagen meniscus implant is manufactured from bovine collagen and should not be confused with the meniscus transplant which involves the replacement of the meniscus with a transplant meniscus from a cadaver donor. The meniscus transplant is not addressed under this national coverage determination.</p>","<p> <strong>    B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>    The Pritikin diet was designed and adopted by Nathan Pritikin in 1955. The diet was modeled after the diet of the Tarahumara Indians in Mexico, which consisted of 10% fat, 13% protein, 75-80% carbohydrates and provided 15-20 grams per day of crude fiber with only 75 mg/day of cholesterol. Over the years, the Pritikin Program (also known as the Pritikin Longevity Program) evolved into a comprehensive program that is provided in a physician&#8217;s office and incorporates a specific diet (10%-15% of calories from fat, 15%-20% from protein, 65%-75% from complex carbohydrates), exercise, and counseling lasting 21-26 days.

<p>Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and is a major contributor to the nation’s increasing medical costs. Despite the growing list of adverse health effects associated with smoking, more than 45 million U.S. adults continue to smoke and approximately 1,200 die prematurely each day from tobacco-related diseases. Annual smoking-attributable expenditures can be measured both in direct medical costs ($96 billion) and in lost productivity ($97 billion), but the results of national surveys have raised concerns that recent declines in smoking prevalence among U.S. adults may have come to an end. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Public Health Service (PHS) Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (2008), 4.5 million adults over 65 years of age smoke cigarettes. Even smokers over age 65, however, can benefit greatly from abstinence, and older smokers who quit can reduce their risk of death from coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer, as well as decrease their risk of osteoporosis.</p>","<p>     <strong>   B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>  
  
<p>     Effective for claims with dates of service on or after August 25, 2010, CMS will cover tobacco cessation counseling for outpatient and hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries</p>  
  
<ol>     
<li>     Who use tobacco, regardless of whether they have signs or symptoms of tobacco-related disease;</li>  
  
<li>     Who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided; and,</li>  
  
<li>     Whose counseling is furnished by a qualified physician or other Medicare-recognized practitioner.</li>  
</ol>  
  
<p> Intermediate and intensive smoking cessation counseling services will be covered under Medicare Part B when the above conditions of coverage are met, subject to frequency and other limitations. That is, similar to existing tobacco cessation counseling for symptomatic individuals, CMS will allow 2 individual tobacco cessation counseling attempts per 12-month period. Each attempt may include a maximum of 4 intermediate OR intensive sessions, with a total benefit covering up to 8 sessions per 12-month period per Medicare beneficiary who uses tobacco. The practitioner and patient have the flexibility to choose between intermediate (more than 3 minutes but less than 10 minutes), or intensive (more than 10 minutes) cessation counseling sessions for each attempt.</p>  
  
<p>     <strong>   C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>  
  
<p>Inpatient hospital stays with the principal diagnosis of tobacco use disorder are not reasonable and necessary for the effective delivery of tobacco cessation counseling services. Therefore, we will not cover tobacco cessation services if tobacco cessation is the primary reason for the patient’s hospital stay.</p>  
  
<p>   <strong>     D. Other</strong></p>  
  
<p>Section 4104 of the Affordable Care Act provided for a waiver of the Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible requirements for this service effective on or after January 1, 2011. Until that time, this service will continue to be subject to the standard Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible requirements.</p>

<p>  Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in men in the United States. In 2009, an estimated 192,280 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and an estimated 27,360 deaths were reported. The National Cancer Institute states that prostate cancer is predominantly a cancer of older men; the median age at diagnosis is 72 years. Once the patient has castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer the median survival is generally less than two years.</p>
<p> In 2010 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sipuleucel-T (PROVENGE&reg;; APC8015), for patients with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer. The posited mechanism of action, immunotherapy, is different from that of anti-cancer chemotherapy such as docetaxel. This is the first immunotherapy for prostate cancer to receive FDA approval.</p>
<p>  The goal of immunotherapy is to stimulate the body's natural defenses (such as the white blood cells called dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes and mononuclear cells) in a specific manner so that they attack and destroy, or at least prevent, the proliferation of cancer cells. Specificity is attained by intentionally exposing a patient's white blood cells to a particular protein (called an antigen) associated with the prostate cancer. This exposure ""trains"" the white blood cells to target and attack the prostate cancer cells. Clinically, this is expected to result in a decrease in the size and/or number of cancer sites, an increase in the time to cancer progression, and/or an increase in survival of the patient.</p>
<p>Sipuleucel-T differs from other infused anti-cancer therapies. Most such anti-cancer therapies are manufactured and sold by a biopharmaceutical company and then purchased by and dispensed from a pharmacy. In contrast, once the decision is made to treat with sipuleucel-T, a multi-step process is used to produce sipuleucel-T. Sipuleucel-T is made individually for each patient with his own white blood cells. The patient’s white blood cells are removed via a procedure called leukapheresis. In a laboratory the white blood cells are exposed to PA2024, which is a molecule created by linking prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). PAP is an antigen specifically associated with prostate cancer cells; GM-CSF is a protein that targets a receptor on the surface of white blood cells. Hence, PAP serves to externally manipulate the immunological functioning of the patient's white blood cells while GM-CSF serves to stimulate the white blood cells into action. As noted in the FDA's clinical review, each dose of sipuleucel-T contains a minimum of 40 million treated white blood cells, however there is ""high inherent variability"" in the yield of sipuleucel-T from leukapheresis to leukapheresis in the same patient as well as from patient to patient. The treated white blood cells are then infused back into the same patient. The FDA-approved dosing regimen is three doses with each dose administered two weeks apart. The total treatment period is four weeks.</p>","<strong>   <p> B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>Transtelephonic monitoring of pacemakers is furnished by commercial suppliers, hospital outpatient departments, and physicians’ offices.</p>
<p>  Telephone monitoring of cardiac pacemakers as described below is medically efficacious in identifying early signs of possible pacemaker failure, thus reducing the number of sudden pacemaker failures requiring emergency replacement. All systems that monitor the pacemaker rate (bpm) in both the free-running and/or magnetic mode are effective in detecting subclinical pacemaker failure due to battery depletion. More sophisticated systems are also capable of detecting internal electronic problems within the pulse generator itself and other potential problems. In the case of dual-chamber pacemakers in particular, such monitoring may detect failure of synchronization of the atria and ventricles, and the need for adjustment and reprogramming of the device.</p>
<p>  <strong>  NOTE:</strong> The transmitting device furnished to the patient is simply one component of the diagnostic system, and is not covered as durable medical equipment. Those engaged in transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring should reflect the costs of the transmitters in setting their charges for monitoring.</p>","<p>  <strong>  B. Definition of Transtelephonic Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>  In order for transtelephonic monitoring services to be covered, the services must consist of the following elements:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">  
<li type=""disc"">  A minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemaker in the free-running mode;</li>
<li type=""disc"">  Unless contraindicated, a minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemaker in the magnetic mode; and</li>
<li type=""disc"">  A minimum 30 seconds of readable ECG strip.</li></ul>

<p>  <strong>  C. Frequency Guidelines for Transtelephonic Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>The guidelines below constitute a system which Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) should use, in conjunction with their knowledge of local medical practices, to screen claims for transtelephonic monitoring prior to payment. It is important to note that they are not recommendations with respect to a minimum frequency for such monitorings, but rather a maximum frequency (within which payment may be made without further claims development). As with previous guidelines, more frequent monitorings may be covered in cases where MACs are satisfied that such monitorings are medically necessary; e.g., based on the condition of the patient, or with respect to pacemakers exhibiting unexpected defects or premature failure.  MACs should seek written justification for more frequent monitorings from the patient’s physician and/or any monitoring service involved.</p>

<p>  These guidelines are divided into two broad categories - Guideline I which will apply to the majority of pacemakers now in use, and Guideline II which will apply only to pacemaker systems (pacemaker and leads) for which sufficient long-term clinical information exists to assure that they meet the standards of the Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources (ICHD) for longevity and end-of-life decay. (The ICHD standards are: (1) 90% cumulative survival at 5 years following implant; and (2) an end-of-life decay of less than a 50% drop of output voltage and less than 20% deviation of magnet rate, or a drop of 5 beats per minute or less, over a period of 3 months or more.)  MACs should consult with their medical advisers and other appropriate individuals and organizations (such as the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology which publishes product reliability information) should questions arise over whether a pacemaker system meets the ICHD standards.</p>

<p>The two groups of guidelines are then further broken down into two general categories – single-chamber and dual-chamber pacemakers.  MACs should be aware that the frequency with which a patient is monitored may be changed from time-to-time for a number of reasons, such as a change in the patient’s overall condition, a reprogramming of the patient’s pacemaker, the development of better information on the pacemaker’s longevity or failure mode, etc. Consequently, changes in the proper set of guidelines may be required.  MACs should inform physicians and monitoring services to alert MACs to any changes in the patient’s monitoring prescription that might necessitate changes in the screening guidelines applied to that patient. (Of particular importance is the reprogramming of a dual-chamber pacemaker to a single-chamber mode of operation. Such reprogramming would shift the patient from the appropriate dual-chamber guideline to the appropriate single-chamber guideline.)</p>

<p>  Such reprogramming would shift the patient from the appropriate dual-chamber guideline to the appropriate single-chamber guideline.)</p>

<p>  <strong>  D. Pacemaker Clinic Services</strong></p>

<p>  1. General</p>

<p>  Pacemaker monitoring is also covered when done by pacemaker clinics. Clinic visits may be done in conjunction with transtelephonic monitoring or as a separate service; however, the services rendered by a pacemaker clinic are more extensive than those currently possible by telephone. They include, for example, physical examination of patients and reprogramming of pacemakers. Thus, the use of one of these types of monitoring does not preclude concurrent use of the other.</p>

<p>  2. Frequency Guidelines</p>

<p>  As with transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring, the frequency of clinic visits is the decision of the patient’s physician, taking into account, among other things, the medical condition of the patient. However, MACs can develop monitoring guidelines that will prove useful in screening claims. The following are recommendations for monitoring guidelines on lithium-battery pacemakers:</p>


<ul type=""disc"">  
<li type=""disc"">  For single-chamber pacemakers - twice in the first 6 months following implant, then once every 12 months.</li><br>
<li type=""disc"">  For dual-chamber pacemakers - twice in the first 6 months, then once every 6 months.</li>

<p>  Among persons older than 65 years, one in six suffers from depression. Depression in older adults is estimated to occur in 25% of those with other illness including cancer, arthritis, stroke, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. Other stressful events, such as the loss of friends and loved ones, are also risk factors for depression. Opportunities are missed to improve health outcomes when mental illness is under-recognized and under-treated in primary care settings.</p>

<p>Older adults have the highest risk of suicide of all age groups. These patients are important in the primary care setting because 50-75% of older adults who commit suicide saw their medical doctor during the prior month for general medical care, and 39% were seen during the week prior to their death. Symptoms of major depression that are felt nearly every day include, but are limited to, feeling sad or empty; less interest in daily activities; weight loss or gain when not dieting; less ability to think or concentrate; tearfulness, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide.</p>

<p>Based upon authority to cover “additional preventive services” for Medicare beneficiaries if certain statutory requirements are met, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new national coverage analysis on screening for depression in adults. Screening for depression in adults is recommended with a grade of B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A and Part B.</p>

<p>  Therefore, effective October 14, 2011, CMS will cover annual screening for depression for Medicare beneficiaries in primary care settings that have staff-assisted depression care supports in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. Various screening tools are available for screening for depression. CMS does not identify specific depression screening tools. Rather, the decision to use a specific tool is at the discretion of the clinician in the primary care setting.</p>

<p>  Coverage is limited to screening services and does not include treatment options for depression or any diseases, complications, or chronic conditions resulting from depression, nor does it address therapeutic interventions such as pharmacotherapy, combination therapy (counseling and medications), or other interventions for depression.</p>","<p>  <strong>  B.

<p> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. CVD, which is comprised of hypertension, coronary heart disease (such as myocardial infarction and angina pectoris), heart failure and stroke, is also the leading cause of hospitalizations. Although the overall adjusted mortality rate from heart disease has declined over the past decade, opportunities for improvement still exist. Risk factors for CVD include being overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, family history of myocardial infarction, and older age.</p>
<p> Under §1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services through the National Coverage Determination (NCD) process if certain statutory requirements are met. Following its review, CMS has determined that the evidence is adequate to conclude that intensive behavioral therapy for CVD is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability, is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B, and is comprised of components that are recommended with a grade of A or B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).</p>","<p> <strong> B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 8, 2011, CMS covers intensive behavioral therapy for CVD (referred to below as a CVD risk reduction visit), which consists of the following three components:</p>
<ul> 
<li> encouraging aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD when the benefits outweigh the risks for men age 45-79 years and women 55-79 years;</li>
<li>screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older; and</li>
<li> intensive behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet for adults with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, advancing age, and other known risk factors for cardiovascular- and diet-related chronic disease.</li>
</ul>

<p> We note that only a small proportion (about 4%) of the Medicare population is under 45 years (men) or 55 years (women), therefore the vast majority of beneficiaries should receive all three components. Intensive behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet is broadly recommended to cover close to 100% of the population due to the prevalence of known risk factors.</p>


<p> Therefore, CMS covers one, face-to-face CVD risk reduction visit per year for Medicare beneficiaries who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided, and whose counseling is furnished by a qualified primary care physician or other primary care practitioner in a primary care setting.</p>

<p>The behavioral counseling intervention for aspirin use and healthy diet should be consistent with the Five As approach that has been adopted by the USPSTF to describe such services:</p>

<ul><li><strong>  Assess:</strong> Ask about/assess behavioral health risk(s) and factors affecting choice of behavior change goals/methods.</li>
<li> <strong>  Advise:</strong> Give clear, specific, and personalized behavior change advice, including information about personal health harms and benefits.</li>
<li> <strong>  Agree:</strong> Collaboratively select appropriate treatment goals and methods based on the patient’s interest in and willingness to change the behavior.</li>
<li> <strong>  Assist:</strong> Using behavior change techniques (self-help and/or counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed-upon goals by acquiring the skills, confidence, and social/environmental supports for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments when appropriate.</li>

<p>Ocular Photodynamic Therapy (OPT) is used in the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases; specifically, for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common eye disease among the elderly. OPT involves the infusion of an intravenous photosensitizing drug called verteporfin followed by exposure to a laser. OPT is only covered when used in conjunction with verteporfin.</p>    
    
<p>Effective July 1, 2001, OPT with verteporfin was approved for a diagnosis of neovascular AMD with predominately classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions (where the area of classic CNV occupies &ge; 50% of the area of the entire lesion) at the initial visit as determined by a fluorescein angiogram (FA).</p>    
    
<p>On October 17, 2001, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced its intent to cover OPT with verteporfin for AMD patients with occult and no classic subfoveal CNV as determined by an FA.  The October 17, 2001, decision was never implemented.</p>    
    
<p>On March 28, 2002, after thorough review and reconsideration of the October 17, 2001, intent to cover policy, CMS determined that the current non-coverage policy for OPT for verteporfin for AMD patients with occult and no classic subfoveal CNV as determined by an FA should remain in effect.</p>    
    
<p>Effective August 20, 2002, CMS issued a non-coverage instruction for OPT with verteporfin for AMD patients with occult and no classic subfoveal CNV as determined by an FA.</p>","<strong><p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>    
    
<p>Effective April 1, 2004, OPT with verteporfin continues to be approved for a diagnosis of neovascular AMD with predominately classic subfoveal CNV lesions (where the area of classic CNV occupies &ge; 50% of the area of the entire lesion) at the initial visit as determined by an FA.  (CNV lesions are comprised of classic and/or occult components.) Subsequent follow-up visits require either an optical coherence tomography (OCT) (effective April 3. 2013) or an FA (effective April 1, 2004) to access treatment response. There are no requirements regarding visual acuity, lesion size, and number of re-treatments when treating predominantly classic lesions.</p>    
    
<p>In addition, after thorough review and reconsideration of the August 20, 2002, non-coverage policy, CMS determines that the evidence is adequate to conclude that OPT with verteporfin is reasonable and necessary for treating:</p>    
    
<ol>  
	<li>Subfoveal occult with no classic CNV associated with AMD; and,  </li>  
	<li>Subfoveal minimally classic CNV (where the area of classic CNV occupies &lt; 50% of the area of the entire lesion) associated with AMD.  </li>  
</ol>  
    
<p>The above 2 indications are considered reasonable and necessary only when:</p>    
<ol>  
	<li>The lesions are small (4 disk areas or less in size) at the time of initial treatment or within the 3 months prior to initial treatment; and,  </li>  
	<li>The lesions have shown evidence of progression within the 3 months prior to initial treatment. Evidence of progression must be documented by deterioration of visual acuity (at least 5 letters on a standard eye examination chart), lesion growth (an increase in at least 1 disk area), or the appearance of blood associated with the lesion.  </li>

<p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. STIs remain an important cause of morbidity in the United States and have both health and economic consequences. Many of the complications of STIs are borne by women and children Often, STIs do not present any symptoms so can go untreated for long periods of time The presence of an STI during pregnancy may result in significant health complications for the woman and infant. In fact, any person who has an STI may develop health complications. Screening tests for the STIs in this national coverage determination (NCD) are laboratory tests.</p>

<p>Under §1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services if certain statutory requirements are met. The regulations provide:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/part-410"">§410.64 Additional preventive services</a></p>

<p>(a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of “preventive services” under §410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the following: (1) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability.(2) recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, (3) appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B.</p>

<p>(b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations.</p>

<p>The scope of the national coverage analysis for this NCD evaluated the evidence for the following STIs and high intensity behavioral counseling (HIBC) to prevent STIs for which the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has issued either an A or B recommendation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screening for chlamydial infection for all sexually active non-pregnant young women aged 24 and younger and for older non-pregnant women who are at increased risk,</li>
<li> Screening for chlamydial infection for all pregnant women aged 24 and younger and for older pregnant women who are at increased risk,</li>
<li> Screening for gonorrhea infection in all sexually active women, including those who are pregnant, if they are at increased risk,</li>
<li>Screening for syphilis infection for all pregnant women and for all persons at increased risk,</li>
<li>Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit,</li>
<li>HIBC for the prevention of STIs for all sexually active adolescents, and for adults at increased risk for STIs.</li></ul>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>CMS has determined that the evidence is adequate to conclude that screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B, as well as HIBC to prevent STIs, consistent with the grade A and B recommendations by the USPSTF, is reasonable and necessary for the early detection or prevention of an illness or disability and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B.</p>

<p>Therefore, effective for claims with dates of services on or after November 8, 2011, CMS will cover screening for these USPSTF-indicated STIs with the appropriate Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA-approved labeling, and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when ordered by the primary care physician or practitioner, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services.</p>

<p>Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pregnant women who are 24 years old or younger when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then repeat screening during the third trimester if high-risk sexual behavior has occurred since the initial screening test.</li>
<li>Pregnant women who are at increased risk for STIs when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then repeat screening during the third trimester if high-risk sexual behavior has occurred since the initial screening test.</li>
<li>Women at increased risk for STIs annually.</li>
</ul>

<p>Screening for syphilis:</p>
<ul>
<li>    Pregnant women when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then repeat screening during the third trimester and at delivery if high-risk sexual behavior has occurred since the previous screening test.</li>
<li>   Men and women at increased risk for STIs annually.</li>
</ul>

<p>Screening for hepatitis B:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Pregnant women at the first prenatal visit when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, and then rescreening at time of delivery for those with new or continuing risk factors.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 8, 2011, CMS will cover up to two individual 20- to 30-minute, face-to-face counseling sessions annually for Medicare beneficiaries for HIBC to prevent STIs, for all sexually active adolescents, and for adults at increased risk for STIs, if referred for this service by a primary care physician or practitioner, and provided by a Medicare eligible primary care provider in a primary care setting. Coverage of HIBC to prevent STIs is consistent with the USPSTF recommendation.</p>

<p>HIBC is defined as a program intended to promote sexual risk reduction or risk avoidance, which includes each of these broad topics, allowing flexibility for appropriate patient-focused elements:</p>

<ul> 
<li>  education,</li>
<li> skills training,</li>
<li> guidance on how to change sexual behavior.</li></ul>

<p> <strong> The high/increased risk</strong> individual sexual behaviors, based on the USPSTF guidelines, include any of the following:</p>

<ul> 
<li>  Multiple sex partners</li>
<li> Using barrier protection inconsistently</li>
<li> Having sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li>
<li> Having sex in exchange for money or drugs</li>
<li> Age (24 years of age or younger and sexually active for women for chlamydia and gonorrhea)</li>
<li> Having an STI within the past year</li>
<li>  IV drug use (for hepatitis B only)</li>
<li>  In addition for men – men having sex with men (MSM) and engaged in high risk sexual behavior, but no regard to age</li></ul>

<p> In addition to individual risk factors, in concurrence with the USPSTF recommendations, community social factors such as high prevalence of STIs in the community populations should be considered in determining high/increased risk for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and for recommending HIBC.</p>

<p>High/increased risk sexual behavior for STIs is determined by the primary care provider by assessing the patient’s sexual history which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit or prenatal visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a reflection of the service provided.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this NCD, a <strong>primary care setting</strong> is defined as the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this NCD, a “<strong>primary care physician</strong>” and “<strong>primary care practitioner</strong>” will be defined based on existing sections of the Social Security Act (§1833(u)(6), §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)).</p>

<p>§1833(u)<br>
(6) Physician Defined.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term “physician” means a physician described in section <u>1861(r)(1)</u> and the term “primary care physician” means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist.</p>

<p>§1833(x)(2)(A)(i)<br>
(I) is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or<br>
(II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5));</p>

<strong><p>C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>Unless specifically covered in this NCD, any other NCD, or in statute, preventive services are non-covered by Medicare.</p>

<strong><p>D. Other</p></strong>

<p>Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible are waived for these preventive services.</p>

<p>HIBC to prevent STIs may be provided on the same date of services as an annual wellness visit, evaluation and management (E&M) service, or during the global billing period for obstetrical car, but only one HIBC may be provided on any one date of service. See the claims processing manual for further instructions on claims processing.</p>

<p> Based upon authority to cover “additional preventive services” for Medicare beneficiaries if certain statutory requirements are met, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new national coverage analysis on intensive behavioral therapy for obesity. Screening for obesity in adults is recommended with a grade of B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A and Part B.</p>

<p> The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that “obesity rates in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, and obesity is now epidemic in the United States.” In the Medicare population over 30% of men and women are obese. Obesity is directly or indirectly associated with many chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal conditions and diabetes.</p>","<strong> <p> B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 29, 2011, CMS covers intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) &#8805; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability.</p>

<p> Intensive behavioral therapy for obesity consists of the following:<br>
<ol> <li> Screening for obesity in adults using measurement of BMI calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters (expressed kg/m<sup>2</sup>);</li>
<li> Dietary (nutritional) assessment; and</li>
<li> Intensive behavioral counseling and behavioral therapy to promote sustained weight loss through high intensity interventions on diet and exercise.</li></ol></p>

<p> The intensive behavioral intervention for obesity should be consistent with the 5-A framework that has been highlighted by the USPSTF:<br>
<ol> <li> <strong> Assess</strong>: Ask about/assess behavioral health risk(s) and factors affecting choice of behavior change goals/methods.</li>
<li> <strong> Advise</strong>: Give clear, specific, and personalized behavior change advice, including information about personal health harms and benefits.</li>
<li> <strong> Agree</strong>: Collaboratively select appropriate treatment goals and methods based on the patient’s interest in and willingness to change the behavior.</li>
<li> <strong> Assist</strong>: Using behavior change techniques (self-help and/or counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed-upon goals by acquiring the skills, confidence, and social/environmental supports for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments when appropriate.</li>
<li> <strong> Arrange</strong>: Schedule follow-up contacts (in person or by telephone) to provide ongoing assistance/support and to adjust the treatment plan as needed, including referral to more intensive or specialized treatment.</li></ol></p>

<p> For Medicare beneficiaries with obesity, who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided and whose counseling is furnished by a qualified primary care physician or other primary care practitioner and in a primary care setting, CMS covers:<br>
<ul> <li> One face-to-face visit every week for the first month;</li>
<li> One face-to-face visit every other week for months 2-6;</li>
<li> One face-to-face visit every month for months 7-12, if the beneficiary meets the 3kg weight loss requirement during the first six months as discussed below.</li></ul></p>

<p> At the six month visit, a reassessment of obesity and a determination of the amount of weight loss must be performed. To be eligible for additional face-to-face visits occurring once a month for an additional six months, beneficiaries must have achieved a reduction in weight of at least 3kg over the course of the first six months of intensive therapy. This determination must be documented in the physician office records for applicable beneficiaries consistent with usual practice. For beneficiaries who do not achieve a weight loss of at least 3kg during the first six months of intensive therapy, a reassessment of their readiness to change and BMI is appropriate after an additional six month period.</p>

<p> For the purposes of this decision memorandum, a primary care setting is defined as one in which there is provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and hospices are not considered primary care settings under this definition.</p>

<p> For the purposes of this decision memorandum a “primary care physician” and “primary care practitioner” will be defined consistent with existing sections of the Social Security Act (§1833(u)(6), §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)).</p>

<p> §1833(u)<br>
(6) Physician Defined.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term “physician” means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term “primary care physician” means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist.</p>

<p> §1833(x)(2)(A)<br>
Primary care practitioner—The term “primary care practitioner” means an individual—<br>
(i) who—<br>
(I) is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or<br>
(II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5))</p>

This stimulator is attached to the surface of the patient’s skin over the peripheral nerve to be stimulated. It may be applied in a variety of settings (in the patient’s home, a physician’s office, or in an outpatient clinic). Payment for TENS may be made under the durable medical equipment benefit.</p>

<p>A. General</p>

<p>For the purposes of this decision chronic low back pain (CLBP) is defined as:</p>

<ol start=""1"">
	<li>an episode of low back pain that has persisted for three months or longer; and</li>
	<li>is not a manifestation of a clearly defined and generally recognizable primary disease entity. For example, there are cancers that, through metastatic spread to the spine or pelvis, may elicit pain in the lower back as a symptom; and certain systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis manifest many debilitating symptoms of which low back pain is not the primary focus.</li>
</ol>","<p>B. Nationally Covered Indications</p>

<p>Effective June 8, 2012, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will allow coverage for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for CLBP only when all of the following conditions are met.</p>

<p>In order to support additional research on the use of TENS for CLBP, we will cover this item under section 1862(a)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act (the Act) subject to all of the following conditions:</p>

<ol start=""1"">
	<li>Coverage under this section expires three years after the publication of this decision on the CMS website.</li>
	<li>The beneficiary is enrolled in an approved clinical study meeting all of the requirements below. The study must address one or more aspects of the following questions in a randomized, controlled design using validated and reliable instruments. This can include randomized crossover designs when the impact of prior TENS use is appropriately accounted for in the study protocol.
	<ol start=""1"" type=""i""><li>Does the use of TENS provide clinically meaningful reduction in pain in Medicare beneficiaries with CLBP?</li>
	<li>Does the use of TENS provide a clinically meaningful improvement of function in Medicare beneficiaries with CLBP?</li>
	<li>Does the use of TENS impact the utilization of other medical treatments or services used in the medical management of CLBP?</li></ol></li>
</ol>

<p>These studies must be designed so that the patients in the control and comparison groups receive the same concurrent treatments and either sham (placebo) TENS or active TENS intervention.</p>

<p>The study must adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:</p>

<ol start=""1"" type=""a"">
	<li>The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular intervention potentially improves the participants’ health outcomes.</li>
	<li>The research study is well supported by available scientific and medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.</li>
	<li>The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies.</li>
	<li> The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the study.</li>
	<li> The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of executing the proposed study successfully.</li>
	<li> The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it must be in compliance with 21 CFR parts 50 and 56.</li>
	<li>All aspects of the research study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see http://www.icmje.org).</li>
	<li>The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare requirements for CED coverage.</li>
	<li>The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR § 312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.</li>
	<li>The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject.</li>
	<li>The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org).</li>
	<li>The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary</li>
	<li>The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility.</li>

<p>Permanent cardiac pacemakers refer to a group of self-contained, battery operated, implanted devices that send electrical stimulation to the heart through one or more implanted leads. They are often classified by the number of chambers of the heart that the devices stimulate (pulse or depolarize). Single chamber pacemakers typically target either the right atrium or right ventricle. Dual chamber pacemakers stimulate both the right atrium and the right ventricle.</p>   
   
<p>The implantation procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia and requires only a brief hospitalization. A catheter is inserted into the chest and the pacemaker’s leads are threaded through the catheter to the appropriate chamber(s) of the heart. The surgeon then makes a small “pocket” in the pad of the flesh under the skin on the upper portion of the chest wall to hold the power source. The pocket is then closed with stitches.</p>   
   
<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that implanted permanent cardiac pacemakers, single chamber or dual chamber, are reasonable and necessary for the treatment of non-reversible symptomatic bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction and second and/or third degree atrioventricular block. Symptoms of bradycardia are symptoms that can be directly attributable to a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (for example: syncope, seizures, congestive heart failure, dizziness, or confusion).</p>","<strong><p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p> 1. Post-cardiotomy (effective for services performed on or after October 18, 1993)</p>
<p>Post-cardiotomy is the period following open-heart surgery. VADs used for support of blood circulation post-cardiotomy are covered only if they have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose, and the VADs are used according to the FDA-approved labeling instructions.</p>
<p>2. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are covered if they are FDA approved for short-term (e.g., bridge-to-recovery and bridge-to-transplant) or long-term (e.g., destination therapy) mechanical circulatory support for heart failure patients who meet the following criteria:</p>
	<ul><li> Have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure; and</li>
		<li>Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le; 25%; and</li>
<li>Are inotrope dependent<br> OR<br>
have a Cardiac Index (CI) &lt; 2.2 L/min/m2, while not on inotropes, and also meet one of the following:<ul>
<li>Are on optimal medical management (OMM), based on current heart failure practice guidelines for at least 45 out of the last 60 days and are failing to respond; or</li>
<li>Have advanced heart failure for at least 14 days and are dependent on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or similar temporary mechanical circulatory support for at least 7 days.</li></ul></ul>
<p>Beneficiaries receiving a VAD must be managed by an explicitly identified, cohesive, multidisciplinary team of medical professionals with appropriate qualifications, training, and experience. The team embodies collaboration and dedication across medical specialties to offer optimal patient-centered care. Collectively, the team must ensure that patients and caregivers have the knowledge and support necessary to participate in informed decision making. The team members must be based at the facility and must include individuals with experience working with patients before and after placement of a VAD.</p>
<p>The team must include, at a minimum:</p>
<ul><li>At least one physician with cardiothoracic surgery privileges and individual experience implanting at least 10 durable, intracorporeal, left ventricular assist devices over the course of the previous 36 months with activity in the last year.</li>
<li>At least one cardiologist trained in advanced heart failure with clinical competence in medical- and device-based management including VADs, and clinical competence in the management of patients before and after placement of a VAD.</li>
	<li>A VAD program coordinator.</li>
	<li> A social worker.</li>
	<li>A palliative care specialist.</li></ul>
<p>Facilities must be credentialed by an organization approved by CMS. The process for organizations to apply for CMS approval to be designated as a credentialing organization for LVAD facilities is posted on our web site along with a list of approved credentialing organizations, approved standard versions, and credentialed facilities: <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/VAD-Destination-Therapy-Facilities.html"">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/VAD-Destination-Therapy-Facilities.html</a></p>

<p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is an infection that attacks the liver and leads to inflammation. The infection is often asymptomatic and can go undiagnosed for decades. It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate the HCV and it is a major cause of chronic liver disease. The presence of HCV in the liver initiates a response from the immune system which in turn causes inflammation. Inflammation over long periods of time (usually decades) can cause scarring, called cirrhosis. A cirrhotic liver fails to perform the normal functions of the liver which leads to liver failure. Cirrhotic livers are more prone to become cancerous and liver failure leads to serious complications, even death. HCV is reported to be the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer and a primary indication for liver transplant in the Western World.</p>

<p>Under &sect;1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services if certain statutory requirements are met. The regulations provide:</p>

<p>42 CFR §410.64 Additional preventive services</p>

<div style=""margin-left: 1cm;""><p>(a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of “preventive services” under 42 CFR §410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the following: (1) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability,(2) recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), (3) appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B.</p>

<p>(b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations.</p>	</div>

<p>The scope of the review for this national coverage determination (NCD) evaluated and determined if the existing body of evidence was sufficient for Medicare coverage for screening for HCV in adults at high risk for HCV infection and one-time screening for HCV infection for adults born between 1945 and 1965, which is recommended with a grade B by the USPSTF.</p>","<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</p>

<p>Effective for services performed on or after June 2, 2014, CMS has determined the following:</p>

<p>The evidence is adequate to conclude that screening for HCV, consistent with the grade B recommendations by the USPSTF, is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B, as described below.</p>

<p>Therefore, CMS will cover screening for HCV with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA-approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act regulations, when ordered by the beneficiary’s primary care physician or practitioner within the context of a primary care setting, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services, for beneficiaries who meet either of the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>A screening test is covered for adults at high risk for HCV infection. “High risk” is defined as persons with a current or past history of illicit injection drug use; and persons who have a history of receiving a blood transfusion prior to 1992. Repeat screening for high risk persons is covered annually only for persons who have had continued illicit injection drug use since the prior negative screening test.</li>
<li>A single screening test is covered for adults who do not meet the high risk definition above, but who were born from 1945 through 1965.</li>
</ol>

<p>The determination of “high risk for HCV” is identified by the primary care physician or practitioner who assesses the patient’s history, which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a reflection of the service provided.</p>

<p>A primary care setting is defined by the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition.</p>

<p>A “primary care physician” and “primary care practitioner” will be defined consistent with existing sections of the Act (&sect;1833(u)(6), §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I) and §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)).</p>

<p>&sect;1833(u)</p>

<p>(6) Physician Defined.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term “physician” means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term “primary care physician” means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist.</p>

<p>&sect;1833(x)(2)(A)(i)</p>

<p>(I) is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or</p>
<p>(II) is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)).</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Non-Covered Indications</p>

<p>Unless specifically covered in this NCD, any other NCD, or in statute, preventive services are non-covered by Medicare.</p>

<p>The fundamental concepts of the Benson-Henry Institute Cardiac Wellness Program were developed by Herbert Benson, MD, over 40 years ago. Benson states that “in the middle 1960s, when I noticed that people’s blood pressures were higher during visits to my office than at other times and wondered whether stress wasn’t causing that rise. Stress wasn’t on the radar then, so I began investigating a connection between stress and hypertension.” (http://www.ideafit.com/fitness-library/mind-body-medicine-balanced-approach) The Cardiac Wellness Program is a multi-component intervention program that includes supervised exercise, behavioral interventions, and counseling, and is designed to reduce cardiovascular risk and improve health outcomes.</p>","<strong><p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) of the mitral valve is used in the treatment of mitral regurgitation. TEER approximates the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets by grasping them with a clipping device in an approach similar to a treatment developed in cardiac surgery called the Alfieri stitch.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>
	
<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) covers TEER of the mitral valve under Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) with the following conditions:</p>
	
<p>A. For the treatment of symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR) when the patient remains symptomatic despite stable doses of maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) plus cardiac resynchronization therapy, if appropriate, or for the treatment of significant symptomatic degenerative MR when furnished according to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication and when all of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ol type=""1"">
<li>The procedure is furnished with a mitral valve TEER system that has received FDA premarket approval (PMA).</li>
<p></p>
<li>The patient (preoperatively and postoperatively) is under the care of a heart team: a cohesive, multidisciplinary, team of medical professionals. The heart team concept embodies collaboration and dedication across medical specialties to offer optimal patient-centered care. The heart team must include the following members with experience and training as specified:</li>
	<ol type=""a"">
<li>Cardiac surgeon<ol type=""i"">
<li>With &ge; 20 mitral valve surgeries per year or &ge; 40 over two years, 50% of which are mitral valve repairs; and,</li>
<li>Who is board eligible or certified in cardiothoracic surgery or similar foreign equivalent.</li></ol>
<li>Interventional cardiologist
	<ol type=""i"">
<li>With professional experience of &ge; 50 career structural heart disease procedures; or &ge; 30 left-sided structural procedures per year; and,</li>
<li>With participation in &ge; 20 career trans-septal interventions including 10 as primary or co-primary operator; and,</li>
<li>Who is board eligible or certified in interventional cardiology or similar foreign equivalent.</li></ol>
<li>Interventional echocardiographer (cardiologist or anesthesiologist)<ol type=""i"">
<li>With professional experience of &ge; 10 trans-septal guidance procedures and &ge; 30 structural heart procedures; and,</li>
<li>Who is board eligible or certified in transesophageal echocardiography with advanced training as required for privileging by the hospital where the TEER is performed.</li></ol>
<li>Heart failure cardiologist experienced in treating patients with advanced heart failure (only required for functional MR patients); and,</li>
<li>Providers from other physician groups as well as advanced patient practitioners, nurses, research personnel, and administrators.</li></ol>
<p></p>
<li>Each patient&#39;s suitability for surgical mitral valve repair, TEER, or palliative therapy must be evaluated, documented, and made available to other heart team members. Additionally, for patients with functional MR, the heart team heart failure cardiologist must document that the patient has persistent symptoms despite maximally tolerated GDMT and cardiac resynchronization therapy, if appropriate, as described below:
	<ol type=""a"">
<li>For patients with functional MR: the heart team interventional cardiologist and heart team heart failure cardiologist independently evaluate the patient using information in the medical record and a face-to-face examination. To decrease patient burden, the heart team heart failure cardiologist may meet this requirement through a review of the patient&#39;s records and images if the patient has an established relationship with a cardiologist experienced in treating patients with advanced heart failure.</li>
<li>For patients with degenerative MR: the heart team interventional cardiologist and heart team cardiac surgeon must independently evaluate the patient using information in the medical record and a face-to-face examination.</li></ol>
<p></p>
<li>An interventional cardiologist or cardiac surgeon from the heart team must perform the mitral valve TEER and an interventional echocardiographer from the heart team must perform transesophageal echocardiography during the procedure. The interventional echocardiographer may not also furnish anesthesiology during the same procedure. The interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon may jointly participate in the intra-operative technical aspects of TEER as appropriate. All physicians who participate in the procedure must have device-specific training as required by the manufacturer.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Mitral valve TEERs must be furnished in a hospital with appropriate infrastructure and experience that includes, but is not limited to:
	<ol type=""a"">
<li>On-site heart valve surgery and interventional cardiology programs;</li>
<li>Post-procedure intensive care facility with personnel experienced in managing patients who have undergone open-heart procedures;</li>
<li>Hospital volume requirements below must be met and maintained:
	<ol type=""i"">
<li> &ge; 20 mitral valve surgical procedures for severe MR per year or &ge; 40 over two years, of which at least 10 (or 20 over two years) must be mitral valve repairs; and,</li>
<li>&ge; 2 physicians with cardiac surgery privileges experienced in valvular surgery; and,</li>
<li>&ge; 1 physician with interventional cardiology privileges; and,</li>
<li>&ge; 300 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) per year.</li></ol></ol>
<p></p>

<li>The heart team and hospital are participating in a prospective, national, audited registry that: 1)comprehensively enrolls TEER patients; 2) accepts all manufactured devices; 3) follows the patient for at least one year; and, 4) complies with relevant regulations relating to protecting human research subjects, including 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46 and 21 CFR Parts 50 & 56.
	
<p>The following outcomes must be tracked by the registry, and the registry must be designed to permit identification and analysis of patient, practitioner, and facility level variables that predict each of these outcomes:</p>
	<ol type=""a"">
	<li>Stroke;</li>
	<li>All-cause mortality;</li>
	<li>Repeat TEER or other mitral procedures;</li>
	<li>Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs);</li>
	<li>Major vascular events;</li>
	<li>Renal complications;</li>
	<li>Functional capacity; and</li>
	<li>Quality of Life (QoL).</li></ol>
<p></p>
<li>The registry shall collect all data necessary and have a written executable analysis plan in place to address the following questions. Specifically, for the CED question d, this must be addressed through a composite metric. For the below CED questions (a-e), the results must be reported publicly as described in CED criterion k.
	<ol type=""a"">
<li>When TEER procedures are performed outside a controlled clinical study, how do outcomes and adverse events compare to the pivotal clinical studies?</li>
<li>How do outcomes and adverse events in subpopulations compare to patients in the pivotal clinical studies?</li>
<li>What is the long-term (&ge; 5 year) durability of the device?</li>
<li>What are the long-term (&ge; 5 year) outcomes and adverse events?</li>
<li>How do the demographics of registry patients compare to the pivotal studies?</li></ol></li>

In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with the study items and /or services, and the use and eventual disposition of the collected data.</li>
<li>All aspects of the research study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity.</li>
<li>The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.</li>
<li>The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.</li>
<li>The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the <a href=""https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov"">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</a> website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. Registries are also registered in the Agency for Healthcare Quality (AHRQ) Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).</li>
<li>The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the study’s primary completion date, which is the date the final subject had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final results must be reported in a publicly accessibly manner; either in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or on-line), in an on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as <a href=""https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with negative or incomplete results).</li>
<li>The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary.</li>
<li>The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility. </li>
	
<p>Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that meet the above-listed standards and address the above-listed research questions.</p>

<p>Stem cell transplantation is a process in which stem cells are harvested from either a patient’s (autologous) or donor’s (allogeneic) bone marrow or peripheral blood for intravenous infusion. Autologous stem cell transplantation (AuSCT) is a technique for restoring stem cells using the patient's own previously stored cells. AuSCT must be used to effect hematopoietic reconstitution following severely myelotoxic doses of chemotherapy (HDCT) and/or radiotherapy used to treat various malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure in which a portion of a healthy donor's stem cell or bone marrow is obtained and prepared for intravenous infusion. Allogeneic HSCT may be used to restore function in recipients having an inherited or acquired deficiency or defect. Hematopoietic stem cells are multi-potent stem cells that give rise to all the blood cell types; these stem cells form blood and immune cells. A hematopoietic stem cell is a cell isolated from blood or bone marrow that can renew itself, differentiate to a variety of specialized cells, can mobilize out of the bone marrow into circulating blood, and can undergo programmed cell death, called apoptosis - a process by which cells that are unneeded or detrimental will self-destruct.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is clarifying that bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a process which includes mobilization, harvesting, and transplant of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells and the administration of high dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to the actual transplant. When bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is covered, all necessary steps are included in coverage. When bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is non-covered, none of the steps are covered.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with the study items and/or services, and the use and eventual disposition of the collected data.
<li> All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity.
<li> The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.
<li> The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.
<li> The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/"">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</a> website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. Registries are also registered in the Agency for Healthcare Quality (AHRQ) Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).
<li> The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the study’s primary completion date, which is the date the final subject had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final results must be reported in a publicly accessibly manner; either in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or on-line), in an on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with negative or incomplete results).
<li> The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary.
<li> The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility.</ol></li></ol>
	
<p>	Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet the above-listed standards and address the above-listed research questions.</p>


	<p><strong>II. Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (AuSCT)</strong></p>
<ol type=""a""><li>Effective for services performed on or after April 28, 1989, AuSCT is considered reasonable and necessary under §l862(a)(1)(A) of the Act for the following conditions and is covered under Medicare for patients with:<br>
<ol type=""1""><li>Acute leukemia in remission who have a high probability of relapse and who have no human leucocyte antigens (HLA)-matched;</li>
<li>Resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or those presenting with poor prognostic features following an initial response;</li>
	<li>Recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma; or,</li>
<li>Advanced Hodgkin's disease who have failed conventional therapy and have no HLA-matched donor.</li></ol><br>
<li>Effective October 1, 2000, single AuSCT is only covered for Durie-Salmon Stage II or III patients that fit the following requirements:<br>
<ul><li>Newly diagnosed or responsive multiple myeloma. This includes those patients with previously untreated disease, those with at least a partial response to prior chemotherapy (defined as a 50% decrease either in measurable paraprotein [serum and/or urine] or in bone marrow infiltration, sustained for at least 1 month), and those in responsive relapse; and</li>
	<li>Adequate cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic function.</li></ul><br>
<li>Effective for services performed on or after March 15, 2005, when recognized clinical risk factors are employed to select patients for transplantation, high dose melphalan (HDM) together with AuSCT is reasonable and necessary for Medicare beneficiaries of any age group with primary amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis who meet the following criteria:
<ul><li>Amyloid deposition in 2 or fewer organs; and,</li>
<li>Cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) greater than 45%.</li></ol>
	<strong><p>C. Nationally Non-Covered Indications</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</strong></p>
<p>Effective for claims with dates of service on or after May 24, 1996, through January 26, 2016, allogeneic HSCT is not covered as treatment for multiple myeloma.</p>

<p><strong>II. Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (AuSCT)</p></strong>

<p>Insufficient data exist to establish definite conclusions regarding the efficacy of AuSCT for the following conditions:</p>
<ol type=""a""><li>Acute leukemia not in remission;</li>  
<li>Chronic granulocytic leukemia;</li> <li>Solid tumors (other than neuroblastoma);</li> <li>Up to October 1, 2000, multiple myeloma;</li> <li>Tandem transplantation (multiple rounds of AuSCT) for patients with multiple myeloma;</li> <li>Effective October 1, 2000, non-primary AL amyloidosis; and,</li> <li>Effective October 1, 2000, through March 14, 2005, primary AL amyloidosis for Medicare beneficiaries age 64 or older.</li></ol>
<p>In these cases, AuSCT is not considered reasonable and necessary within the meaning of §l862(a)(1)(A) of the Act and is not covered under Medicare.</p>

<p>Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), an irregular heartbeat, are at an increased risk of stroke. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a tubular structure that opens into the left atrium and has been shown to be one potential source for blood clots that can cause strokes. While thinning the blood with anticoagulant medications has been proven to prevent strokes, percutaneous LAA closure (LAAC) has been studied as a non-pharmacologic alternative for patients with AF.</p>","<p><strong>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<ol type=""a"">
	<li>LAAC devices are covered when the device has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Premarket Approval (PMA) for that device’s FDA-approved indication and meet all of the conditions specified below:   </li>
</ol>
   
<p>The patient must have:</p>   
   
<ul>
<li>A CHADS2 score &ge; 2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age &gt; 75, Diabetes, Stroke/transient ischemia attack/thromboembolism) or CHA2DS2-VASc score &ge; 3 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age &ge; 65, Diabetes, Stroke/transient ischemia attack/thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Sex category)</li>   
<li>A formal shared decision making interaction with an independent non-interventional physician using an evidence-based decision tool on oral anticoagulation in patients with NVAF prior to LAAC. Additionally, the shared decision making interaction must be documented in the medical record.</li>   
<li>A suitability for short-term warfarin but deemed unable to take long-term oral anticoagulation following the conclusion of shared decision making, as LAAC is only covered as a second line therapy to oral anticoagulants. The patient (preoperatively and postoperatively) is under the care of a cohesive, multidisciplinary team (MDT) of medical professionals. The procedure must be furnished in a hospital with an established structural heart disease (SHD) and/or electrophysiology (EP) program.</li>
</ul>   
   
<p>The procedure must be performed by an interventional cardiologist(s), electrophysiologist(s), or cardiovascular surgeon (s) that meet the following criteria:</p>   
   
<ul>
<li> Has received training prescribed by the manufacturer on the safe and effective use of the device prior to performing LAAC; and,</li>   
<li> Has performed &ge; 25 interventional cardiac procedures that involve transeptal puncture through an intact septum; and,</li>   
<li>Continues to perform &ge; 25 interventional cardiac procedures that involve transeptal puncture through an intact septum, of which at least 12 are LAAC, over a 2-year period.</li>
</ul>   
   
<p>The patient is enrolled in, and the MDT and hospital must participate in, a prospective, national, audited registry that: 1) consecutively enrolls LAAC patients, and, 2) tracks the following annual outcomes for each patient for a period of at least 4 years from the time of the LAAC:</p>   

<ul>
<li> Operator-specific complications</li>   
<li>Device-specific complications including device thrombosis</li>

<li>Systemic embolism</li>   
<li>Death</li>   
<li>Major bleeding, by site and severity</li>
</ul>   
   
<p>The registry must be designed to permit identification and analysis of patient, practitioner, and facility level factors that predict patient risk for these outcomes. The registry must collect all data necessary to conduct analyses adjusted for relevant confounders, and have a written executable analysis plan in place to address the following questions:</p>   
   
<ul>
<li>How do the outcomes listed above compare to outcomes in the pivotal clinical trials in the short term (&le; 12 months) and in the long term (&ge; 4 years)?</li>   
<li>What is the long term (&ge; 4 year) durability of the device?</li>   
<li>What are the short term (&le; 12 months) and the long term (&ge; 4 years) device-specific complications including device thromboses?</li>
</ul>   
   
<p>To appropriately address some of these questions, Medicare claims or other outside data may be necessary.</p>   

<p>Registries must be reviewed and approved by CMS. Potential registry sponsors must submit all registry documentation to CMS for approval, including the written executable analysis plan and auditing plan. CMS will review the qualifications of candidate registries to ensure that the approved registry follows standard data collection practices, and collects data necessary to evaluate the patient outcomes specified above.

<p>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is transmitted by exposure to blood or blood-containing body fluids such as serum, semen or saliva. HBV infection attacks the liver and leads to inflammation.  An infected person may initially develop symptoms such as nausea, anorexia, fatigue, fever and abdominal pain, or may be asymptomatic.  An acute HBV infection may become a chronic infection and progress to serious and potentially life-threatening complications including cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and death.</p>

<p>Pursuant to §1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary may add coverage of ""additional preventive services"" if certain statutory requirements are met.</p>","<p><strong><em>B</em>. Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>Effective for services performed on or after September 28, 2016, CMS has determined that the evidence is sufficient to cover screening for HBV infection with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when ordered by the beneficiary's primary care physician or practitioner within the context of a primary care setting, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services, for beneficiaries who meet either of the following conditions.</p>

<ol>
	<li>A screening test is covered for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection. ""High risk"" is defined as persons born in countries and regions with a high prevalence of HBV infection (i.e., &ge; 2%), US born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with a very high prevalence of HBV infection (i.e., &ge; 8%), HIV-positive persons, men who have sex with men, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection.  In addition, CMS has determined that repeated screening would be appropriate annually only for beneficiaries with continued high risk (i.e., men who have sex with men, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection) who do not receive hepatitis B vaccination.</li>
<br>
	<li>A screening test at the first prenatal visit is covered for pregnant women and then rescreening at time of delivery for those with new or continuing risk factors.  In addition, CMS has determined that screening during the first prenatal visit would be appropriate for each pregnancy, regardless of previous hepatitis B vaccination or previous negative HBsAg test results.</li>
</ol>

<p>The determination of ""high risk for HBV"" is identified by the primary care physician or practitioner who assesses the patient's history, which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a reflection of the service provided.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this decision memorandum, a primary care setting is defined by the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this decision memorandum, a ""primary care physician"" and ""primary care practitioner"" will be defined consistent with existing sections of the Social Security Act (§1833(u)(6), §1833(x) (2)(A)(i)(I) and §1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II)).</p>

<p>§1833(u)<br>
<em>(6)</em> Physician Defined.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term ""physician"" means a physician described in section 1861(r)(1) and the term ""primary care physician"" means a physician who is identified in the available data as a general practitioner, family practice practitioner, general internist, or obstetrician or gynecologist.</p>

<p>§1833(x)(2)(A)(i)<br>
<em>(I)</em> is a physician (as described in section 1861(r)(1)) who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine; or</p>

<p><em>(II)</em> is a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant (as those terms are defined in section 1861(aa)(5)).</p>

<p>The leadless pacemaker eliminates the need for a device pocket and insertion of a pacing lead which are integral elements of traditional pacing systems. The removal of these elements eliminate an important source of complications associated with traditional pacing systems while providing similar benefits. Leadless pacemakers are delivered via catheter to the heart, and function similarly to other transvenous single-chamber ventricular pacemakers.</p>","<strong><p>B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>

<p>Effective January 18, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) covers leadless pacemakers through Coverage with Evidence Development (CED). CMS covers leadless pacemakers when procedures are performed in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved studies. CMS also covers, in prospective longitudinal studies, leadless pacemakers that are used in accordance with the FDA approved label for devices that have either:</p>

<ul>
	<li> an associated ongoing FDA approved post-approval study; or</li>
	<li> completed an FDA post-approval study.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each study must be approved by CMS and as a fully-described, written part of its protocol, must address the following research questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li> What are the peri-procedural and post-procedural complications of leadless pacemakers?</li>
	<li> What are the long term outcomes of leadless pacemakers?</li>
	<li> What are the effects of patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities) on the use and health effects of leadless pacemakers?</li>
</ul>

<p>CMS will review studies to determine if they meet the 13 criteria listed below. If CMS determines that they meet these criteria, the study will be posted on CMS’ CED website (<a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with-Evidence-Development/index.html"">https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with-Evidence-Development/index.html</a>).</p>

<ol type=""a"">
	<li> The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item or service meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected beneficiaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects.</li>
	<li> The rationale for the study is well supported by available scientific and medical evidence.</li>
	<li> The study results are not anticipated to unjustifiably duplicate existing knowledge.</li>
	<li> The study design is methodologically appropriate and the anticipated number of enrolled subjects is sufficient to answer the research question(s) being asked in the National Coverage Determination.</li>
	<li> The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of completing it successfully.</li>
	<li> The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is also in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with the study items and/or services, and the use and eventual disposition of the collected data.</li>
	<li> All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity.</li>
	<li> The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.</li>
	<li> The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.</li>
	<li> The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the www.ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. Registries are also registered in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).</li>
	<li> The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the study’s primary completion date, which is the date the final subject had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final results must be reported in a publicly accessibly manner; either in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or on-line), in an on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with negative or incomplete results).</li>
	<li> The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are necessary.</li>
	<li> The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet the above-listed standards and address the above-listed research questions.</p>

<p>All clinical research study protocols must be reviewed and approved by CMS. The principal investigator must submit the complete study protocol, identify the relevant CMS research question(s) that will be addressed and cite the location of the detailed analysis plan for those questions in the protocol, plus provide a statement addressing how the study satisfies each of the standards of scientific integrity (a. through m. listed above), as well as the investigator’s contact information, to the address below. The information will be reviewed, and approved studies will be identified on the CMS website.</p>

<p>Cancer is a collection of related diseases of dividing cells that can start almost anywhere in or on the body, evade the immune system, and invade nearby tissues. Categories of cancer are typically organized by the location in the body and specific type of cell. These categories may include carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, melanoma, and brain and spinal cord tumors. There are also changes to these cells that are not considered cancer. These changes include hyperplasia—when a cell divides faster than normal—and dysplasia—a buildup of extra cells with abnormal shape and disorganization.</p>

<p>A person’s immune system contains cells to help fight substances that are foreign to the body, including cancer. These cells are called white blood cells, most of which are lymphocytes. The two main types of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes (B-cells) and T lymphocytes (T-cells). B-cells generate and release antibodies to fight infection, especially bacterial infections, while T-cells employ a number of other mechanisms to fight abnormal cells such as cancer. One type of therapy that leverages the immune system—immunotherapy—is Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.</p>

<p>CAR T-cells have been genetically altered in order to improve the ability of the T-cells to fight cancer. The genetic modification creating a CAR can enhance the ability of the T-cell to recognize and attach to a specific protein, called an antigen, on the surface of a cancer cell.</p>","<p><strong>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally Covered Indications</strong></p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a currently irreversible brain disorder that progressively degrades memory, cognitive function, and ability to carry out tasks of daily living. AD is the number one cause of dementia in older Americans.
Antiamyloid-beta monoclonal antibodies (antiamyloid mAbs) are laboratory-made proteins designed to bind a specific substance in the body, with the goal of marking it for destruction by the body’s immune system. Scientists design various mAbs as treatments with the goal of targeting and neutralizing or clearing infections (like the COVID-19 virus), cancer cells, and in the case of AD, amyloid accumulation in the brain.</p>","<p><strong>B. Nationally Covered Indications</p></strong>
<p>Effective April 7, 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) covers Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of AD when furnished in accordance with Section B under coverage with evidence development (CED) for patients who have a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia, both with confirmed presence of amyloid beta pathology consistent with AD.</p>
<p>Coverage Criteria:</p>
<p>1) Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a change in a surrogate endpoint (e.g., amyloid reduction) considered as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may be covered in a randomized controlled trial conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application.</p>
<p>2) Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a direct measure of clinical benefit may be covered in CMS-approved prospective comparative studies. Study data for CMS-approved prospective comparative studies may be collected in a registry.</p>

<p>3) For CMS-approved studies, the protocol, including the analysis plan, must include:</p>
<ol><li class type=""a"">A study population whose diversity of patients are representative of the national population with 	MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia.</li>
<li class type=""a"">A neurocognitive evaluation and a description of the instruments used to assess cognition and function for the clinical diagnosis of MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia for study enrollment and outcomes assessment.</li>
<li class type=""a"">A description of:<br>
<ol><li class type=""i"">The multidisciplinary dementia team and optimal medical management.</li>
<li class type=""i"">Study sites with clinical expertise and infrastructure to provide treatments consistent with the safety monitoring outlined in the FDA-approved label.</li></ol></ol></p>
<p>4) CMS-approved studies of a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid (antiamyloid mAb) approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a direct measure of clinical benefit must address all of the questions below:</p>
<p>a. Does the antiamyloid mAb meaningfully improve health outcomes (i.e., slow the decline of cognition and function) for patients in broad community practice?</p>
<p>b. Do benefits, and harms such as brain hemorrhage and edema, associated with use of the antiamyloid mAb, depend on characteristics of patients, treating clinicians, and settings?</p>
<p>c. How do the benefits and harms change over time?</p>

<p>5) CMS-approved studies must adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity that have been identified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ):</p>
<p>a. The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item or service meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected beneficiaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects.<br>
b. The rationale for the study is well supported by available scientific and medical evidence.<br>
c. The study results are not anticipated to unjustifiably duplicate existing knowledge.<br>
d. The study design is methodologically appropriate and the anticipated number of enrolled subjects is sufficient to answer the research question(s) being asked in the National Coverage Determination (NCD).<br>
e. The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of completing it successfully.<br>
f. The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it is also in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with the study items and/or services, and the use and eventual disposition of the collected data.<br>
g. All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate standards of scientific integrity.<br>
h. The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.<br>
i. The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.<br>
j. The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the <a href =""https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first study subject. Registries are also
registered in the AHRQ Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).<br>
k. The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the study’s primary completion date, which is the date the final subject had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final results must be reported in a publicly accessible manner; either in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or online), in an on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with negative or incomplete results).<br>

<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em>Heart failure (HF) is a chronic syndrome in which the heart muscle cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. HF patients are prone to fluid retention in the body, including the lungs (pulmonary congestion), which results in shortness of breath, fatigue, and limitations of everyday activities such as walking or climbing stairs. Worsening of these symptoms can lead to acute decompensated HF (ADHF) and hospitalization. A change in blood flow, measured by pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, precedes symptoms of HF. The purpose of an implantable PA pressure sensor (IPAPS) is early detection of the change in blood flow, allowing medical intervention intended to prevent symptom onset, further exacerbation and hospitalization. An IPAPS and external data gathering unit are used in the patient’s home to send a patient’s PA pressure trends to their physician, allowing better management of medications, lifestyle adjustments, and office visits to prevent or reduce acute HF episodes.</em></font></p>","<p><strong><font color=""#FF0000""><em>B.

<p>Implantation of an IPAPS is covered for HF management when furnished according to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) market-authorized indication and all of the following conditions are met:</p></font></em>
<p><font color=""#FF0000""><strong><em>1. Patient Criteria</font></strong></p></em>
<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em>The patient meets all of the following criteria:</p>
<p>
a) Diagnosis of chronic HF of at least 3 months duration and in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class II or III within the past 30 days, prior to PAPS implantation, regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).</p>
<p>b) History of HF hospitalization or urgent HF visit (emergency room (ER) or other outpatient (OP) visit requiring intravenous (IV) diuretic therapy) within the past 12 months, or elevated natriuretic peptides within the past 30 days.</p>

<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em>b) An active comparator.</p></font></em>
<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em>c) A care management plan that:</em><br>
<ul>
<li> <em>Identifies members, roles and responsibilities of the physician-led HF clinical team (e.g., physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses) that performs the follow-up IPAPS patient monitoring and medication management; and</li></em>
<li> <em>Specifies the medication management protocols the patient and HF clinical team must follow.</li></em></ul></font></p>
		
<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em>d) Design sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility of the IPAPS for HF management using direct measures of clinical behavior (e.g., counts of patient/physician interactions, counts and type of medication changes, counts of unscheduled outpatient clinic visits, counts of days within clinician set thresholds) to effectively manage and improve patient outcomes.</p></font></em>

<p><font color=""#FF0000"">e) Design sufficient for subgroup analyses by:</p></em></font>
		
<font color=""#FF0000""><em><ul><li>CRT-P, CRT-D, or ICD (with hemodynamic monitoring capabilities) status (with/without);</li>
<li>Age (75+ years);</li>

<li>LVEF (by guideline-defined subgroups);</li>
<li>NYHA Class II vs III (as appropriate based on the FDA-approved label);</li>
<li>Stage IV or greater chronic kidney disease;</li>
<li>HF hospitalization in the past 12 months vs elevated natriuretic peptides alone in the last 30 days.</li></ul></font></em>

<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em> f) CMS-approved CED studies must adhere to the following scientific standards (criteria 1-17 below) that have been identified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as set forth in Section VI. of CMS’ Coverage with Evidence Development Guidance Document, published August 7.<br> <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/medicare-coverage-document.aspx?mcdid=38"">https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/medicare-coverage-document.aspx?mcdid=38</a></p></em></font>

<p><font color=""#FF0000""><em>1. Sponsor/Investigator: The study is conducted by sponsors/investigators with the resources and skills to
complete it successfully.</p>
<p>2. Milestones: A written plan is in place that describes a detailed schedule for completion of key study milestones, including study initiation, enrollment progress, interim results reporting, and results reporting, to ensure timely completion of the CED process.</p>
<p>3. Study Protocol: The CED study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and a complete final protocol, including the statistical analysis plan, is delivered to CMS prior to study initiation. The published protocol includes sufficient detail to allow a judgment of whether the study is fit-for-purpose and whether reasonable efforts will be taken to minimize the risk of bias. Any changes to approved study protocols should be explained and publicly reported.</p>
<p>4. Study Context: The rationale for the study is supported by scientific evidence and study results are expected to fill the specified CMS-identified evidence deficiency and provide evidence sufficient to assess health outcomes.</p>
<p>5. Study Design: The study design is selected to safely and efficiently generate valid evidence of health outcomes. The sponsors/investigators minimize the impact of confounding and biases on inferences through rigorous design and appropriate statistical techniques. If a contemporaneous comparison group is not included, this choice should be justified, and the sponsors/investigators discuss in detail how the design contributes useful information on issues such as durability or adverse event frequency that are not clearly answered in comparative studies.</p>
<p>6. Study Population: The study population reflects the demographic and clinical diversity among the Medicare beneficiaries who are the intended population of the intervention, particularly when there is good clinical or scientific reason to expect that the results observed in premarket studies might not be observed in older adults or subpopulations identified by other clinical or demographic factors. At a minimum, this includes attention to the intended population’s racial and ethnic backgrounds, gender, age, disabilities, important comorbidities, and, dependent on data availability, relevant health related social needs. For instance, more than half of Medicare beneficiaries are women so study designs should, as appropriate, consider the prevalence in women of the condition being studied as well as in the clinical trial and subsequent data reporting and analyses.</p>

<p>7. Subgroup Analyses: The study protocol explicitly discusses beneficiary subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion requirements effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. In the protocol, the sponsors/investigators describe plans for analyzing demographic subpopulations as well as clinically relevant subgroups as identified in existing evidence. Description of plans for exploratory analyses, as relevant subgroups emerge, are also included.</p>
<p>8. Care Setting: When feasible and appropriate for answering the CED question, data for the study should come from beneficiaries in their expected sites of care.</p>
<p>9. Health Outcomes: The primary health outcome(s) for the study are those important to patients and their caregivers and that are clinically meaningful. A validated surrogate outcome that reliably predicts these outcomes may be appropriate for some questions. Generally, when study sponsors propose using surrogate
endpoints to measure outcomes, they should cite validation studies published in peer-reviewed journals to provide a rationale for assuming these endpoints predict the health outcomes of interest. The cited validation studies should be longitudinal and demonstrate a statistical association between the surrogate endpoint and
the health outcomes it is thought to predict.</p>
<p>10. Objective Success Criteria: In consultation with CMS and AHRQ, sponsors/investigators establish an evidentiary threshold for the primary health outcome(s) to demonstrate clinically meaningful differences with sufficient precision.</p>
<p>11. Data Quality: The data are generated or selected with attention to provenance, bias, completeness, accuracy, sufficiency of duration of observation to demonstrate durability of health outcomes, and sufficiency of sample size as required by the question.</p>
<p>12. Construct Validity: Sponsors/investigators provide information about the validity of drawing warranted conclusions about the study population, primary exposure(s) (intervention, control), health outcome measures, and core covariates when using either primary data collected for the study about individuals or proxies of the variables of interest, or existing (secondary) data about individuals or proxies of the variables of interest.</p>
<p>13. Sensitivity Analyses: Sponsors/investigators will demonstrate robustness of results by conducting prespecified sensitivity testing using alternative variable or model specifications as appropriate.</p>
<p>14. Reporting: Final results are provided to CMS and submitted for publication or reported in a publicly accessible manner within 12 months of the study’s primary completion date. Wherever possible, the study is submitted for peer review with the goal of publication using a reporting guideline appropriate for the study design and structured to enable replication. If peer-reviewed publication is not possible, results may also be published in an online publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with incomplete results).</p>
<p>15. Sharing: The sponsors/investigators commit to making study data publicly available by sharing data,
methods, analytic code, and analytical output with CMS or with a CMS-approved third party. The study should comply with all applicable laws regarding subject privacy, including 45 CFR § 164.514 within the regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and 42 CFR, Part 2: Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records.</p>
<p>16. Governance: The protocol describes the information governance and data security provisions that have been established to satisfy Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and codified at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 (Subparts A & C), United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations at 42 CFR, Part 2: Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient and HHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 46, regarding informed consent for clinical study involving human subjects. In addition to the requirements under 42 CFR and 45 CFR, studies that are subject to FDA regulation must also comply with regulations at 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 regarding the protection of human subjects and institutional review boards, respectively.</p>
<p>17. Legal: The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals, although it is acceptable for a study to test a reduction in toxicity of a product relative to standard of care or an appropriate comparator. For studies that involve researching the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and biological products aimed at treating life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, refer to additional requirements set forth in 21 CFR § 312.81(a).</p>
<p>Consistent with section 1142 of the Social Security Act, AHRQ supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet all the criteria and standards identified above.</p></font></em>
